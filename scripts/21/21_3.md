## Aligning Objects
Alignment snaps selected parts to an imaginary line coming from a side or center of a guide component. After placing objects roughly in position, you can select several objects and automatically align them. The alignment command aligns all selected objects with the last one selected.

You can use Align with: pins (and align components by those pins), reference designators, unions in the Layout Editor, and terminals and terminal numbers in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Using Ctrl+click, select the objects you want to include in the alignment ensuring that you select the master object last.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Align** popup menu item.

**Restriction:**

You cannot align elements in a physical design reuse. Align becomes unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

3. In the Align dialog boxon page 1080, click the alignment scheme you want to use. The objects are automatically aligned according to the position of the last one selected.

Automatic alignment does not guarantee minimum spacing if on-line DRC is not enabled, but you can use Nudge to accomplish this interactively. If On-line DRC is set to Prevent or Warn, Align does not perform the alignment if it causes a violation. Violations are reported in the status bar.

## Rotating an Object
You can rotate objects in 90 degree increments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object to rotate. You can select more than one object at a time.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Rotate 90** popup menu item. The selected object rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.

If you rotate a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

When you rotate a group, an error may appear in one of the Trace Copy dialog boxes. For more information, see "Trace Copy Dialog Box."

If you try to rotate a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_25_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** To use Rotate 90 in Verb Mode, click the **Rotate** button on the Design Toolbar and then select the part to rotate.

3. Repeat step 2 to continue rotating the objects.

## Spinning an Object
You can spin an object on its axis during part placement.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object to spin.
- 2. Right-click and click **Spin**. The part attaches to the pointer. As you move the pointer, the part follows, changing the rotation angle.

You can multiple-select and rotate a group of parts in the same way; each turns on its own axis.

To view the angle of rotation as you spin the part, right-click and click **Properties**. The current angle appears in the Rotation box.

If you spin a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

If you try to spin a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.

- 3. Click to indicate a new angle.
- 4. To use Spin in Verb Mode, click the **Spin** button on the Design Toolbar, and then select the part to spin. click to indicate a new angle.

## Swapping Parts
Sometimes simply switching neighboring parts' positions can improve connection length. You can swap the position of two parts anywhere on the board using the "Swap Part" command. When Online DRC is selected, the swap is examined for placement violations.

**Procedure**

- 1. To begin, use one of the following methods:
	- **For a single swap**  Select a part > Design Toolbar button > **Swap Part** button.
	- **For multiple swaps Design Toolbar** button > **Swap Part** button > select the first part to switch.
- 2. Select the second part to switch.
- 3. You are prompted to allow the swap and at the same time, the X + Y connection lengths before and after the swap appear in the status bar so you can see whether the lengths improve.
- 4. Click **Yes** to complete the swap. Parts are swapped origin-to-origin.

If you chose the multiple swap method and you are still in Swap Part mode, you can continue to choose parts to swap.

## Interactive Placement Tools
You can place parts to exact tolerances using the alignment and nudge tools.

When placing parts interactively, note the following effects of alignment and nudge:

- Alignment snaps selected parts along an imaginary line coming from a side or center of a guide component.
- Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_27_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** For nudging, all component elements are considered glued. Align and Nudge are unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

Nudging Parts

### Nudging Parts
When parts are close enough to violate either pad-to-pad or body-to-body clearance rules, they are considered overlapping.

Nudge and Design Rule Checking \(DRC\) Nudge Overlapping Parts Nudging All Components Nudging Single Parts

#### Nudge and Design Rule Checking (DRC)
When DRC is set to Prevent, SailWind Layout actively prevents overlapping by canceling the completion of an illegal move and returning the selected component to Move mode.

This automatic checking can be further refined using Nudge. Nudge is a shove function for parts; it resolves overlapping by moving surrounding parts away from the part you are trying to place. Nudge has three operational modes that you set on the **Design** category of the Options dialog box. As shown in the table below, Nudge operation is dependent on the current DRC setting:

**Table 101. DRC Setting and Nudge Modes**

When you use Nudge for placement, SailWind Layout approximates the component size. For example, if you placed an L-shaped component, SailWind Layout approximates that part area as a square, not as an L. Nudge then uses the greater of the pad-to-pad or body-to-body clearances defined in Design Rules setup to determine the distance that must exist between two components.

In many cases, several parts are adjusted to accommodate the moved part. Nudge does not move glued parts or parts outside the board outline. Nudge treats test points as glued objects. Nudge does not move parts inside the board outline outside the outline. When an overlap exists, the Nudge Parts and Unions dialog box appears.

Nudge does adhere to the current grid setting, so be sure you set the grid fine enough for the command place within the restrictions of your routing strategy.

#### Nudge Overlapping Parts
Use Nudge to move overlapping parts. The manner in which Nudge operates is dependent on the current DRC setting.

<span id="page-29-2"></span>For more information, see Nudging Parts.

#### Nudging All Components
You can move all overlapping parts at once using the Nudge Components command. Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component.

**Procedure**

Click the **Tools > Nudge Components** menu command.

<span id="page-29-3"></span>All components are automatically nudged according to the design rules.

#### Nudging Single Parts
Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component. You can use Nudge to move an individual part that overlaps another part.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a part.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Nudge** popup menu item. For more information, see

Nudge does not move glued parts or parts outside the board outline. Parts inside the board outline are not nudged outside the outline.

Nudge considers test points to be glued objects.

You cannot nudge elements in a physical design reuse. All component elements are considered glued. Nudge is unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

- 3. In the Nudge Parts and Unions Dialog Boxon page 1495, click the nudge direction and the direction to move overlapping parts.
- 4. Click **Run** to perform the nudge.
- 5. Often, several parts are adjusted to accommodate the moved part. Nudge identifies these parts, and allows for further adjustments, by displaying them in a specific color:
	- **Select color**  All parts affected by the Nudge routine.
	- **Highlight color**  The part to move in the next pass of Nudge.

## Changing the Part Outline Width
You use this procedure to change the width of the 2D lines that indicate the part outline on Silkscreen Top/ Bottom layers.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• This procedure does not apply to placement (nudge) outlines created on Layer 20.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a component, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. Type a width (between 0 and 250) in the Part Outline Width box.
- 3. Click **OK**.

This change is reflected in the design only; the library is not updated.

Alternate decals in use are modified; alternate decals not in use are not modified.

Online DRC "Body to body" checking and Verify the Design look at the part outline when checking.

| CAUTION: |  |  |
|----------|--|--|
|          |  |  |

In SailWind Layout, the "Body to body" clearance checks are performed between the edges of the lines used to define the component body outlines. Increasing the widths of these lines may impact the spacing between existing components in the design and require you to perform a Verify Design Clearance check to assure that all of the "Body to body" clearances are maintained.

4. To update all parts that have the same decals as the selected parts with the new part outline width, click **Continue**.

## Modifying Component Properties
You can edit or change component properties to reflect changes in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a component.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. The Component Properties Dialog Box appears.

**Restriction:**

Several of the options on the dialog box are unavailable when the component is part of a physical design reuse.

3. Make any necessary changes and click **OK**.

## Creating a Label
You can create labels using the **Labels** tab in the Component Properties dialog box.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a component.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. The Component Properties Dialog Box appears.
- 3. On the **Labels** tab, in the Label list, click <new> and click the **Label** button. For more information, see Adding a New Part Label.
- 4. From the Attribute list, click the attribute for which you want to create a label. When you click an attribute, the value for the attribute appears in the Value box.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_31_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

The only attribute available for jumpers is the reference designator.

5. Accept the current value or type a new value. If you click Reference Designator or Part Type from the Attribute list, you cannot change the value.

This box is unavailable if the attribute is read-onlyon page 1853. This box is also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824 and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.

- 6. Set the visibility status and the placement information for the label.
- 7. Set the justification, right-readability, height, and width of the label.
- 8. Click the layer on which to place the label, and then click **OK** to create the label.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_31_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** If you do not set visibility information (such as in steps 4, 5, and 6), default positions are used. For more information, see Label Defaults.

**Note:**

Labels are not checked for clearance violations. If you want to output labels from CAM as metal or copper, such as on a Routing layer, check your label placement carefully.

## Editing a Label
The Label List contains existing labels for reference designators, part types, and attributes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a component.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. The Component Properties Dialog Box appears.
- 3. On the **Labels** tab, click a label in the list and click the **Label** button in this tab.

4. A label is selected instead of the component, and the corresponding Part Label Properties dialog boxon page 590 appears where you can modify the label.

## Cluster and Union Placement
Use cluster placement features to create associations or groupings of connected parts.

Two object types are used:

- **Unions**  are user-created part associations that have a strict relationship with each other. An example of this is associating a filter capacitor to reside on top of an IC. When you move or place a selected union, the physical relationship between the parts, or union members, remains unchanged. Unions are not created using the Cluster Placement routines, but they are considered during cluster creation and automatic placement operations. For information, see the Unionstopic.
- **Clusters**  are collections of individual parts, unions, and other clusters, based on connectivity. A series of ICs and associated discrete components that make up a memory array could make up a cluster. Clusters differ from unions because the parts that belong to the cluster, or cluster members, are rearranged within the cluster to improve placement.

Clusters are useful in very large designs or in designs where areas of the board are separated into different functions. You can create or modify clusters manually or automatically. You can also automatically place individual parts using this feature. For more information, see the Placing Parts  Automaticallyand Moving Clusters Interactivelytopics.

Any operation that creates, displays, or modifies clusters (except the Cluster Manager) automatically places you in Cluster View mode. For more information, see the Cluster View Mode topic.

**Cluster Display Settings**

The circle that represents a cluster is assigned in the Display Colors Setup dialog box as a 2D Lines property on the Top layer. The text representing the cluster name is assigned as a Text property on layer 20.

The connection lines originating from the center of the cluster (the same as in the normal view) are assigned with the Connection setting in the Display Colors Setup dialog box.

## Unions
*Unions* are user-created part associations that have a strict relationship with each other, such as distance, rotation angle, top, or bottom side.

A common example is placing a filter capacitor to reside on top of an IC. When a selected union is moved or placed, the physical relationship between the parts, or union members, remains unchanged.
