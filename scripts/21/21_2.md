## Sequential Component Placement
After selecting a predetermined set of components, you can use the "Move Sequential" command to sequentially place components on your pointer for placement in the design.

Placing Components Sequentially Using the Find Dialog Box Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace

### Placing Components Sequentially Using the Find Dialog Box
Use the Find dialog box to choose components by selecting them from a list. This method places the components on your cursor in alphanumeric order.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Find** menu item.
- 2. In the Find Dialog Box, set Find by to Ref. Designator, Part Type, Decals, Unions or Clusters.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** Select multiple Ref. Des. prefixes, part types or decals in order to expand the list of available components.

- 3. From the resulting list, select all the parts you want to move. Drag or use Shift-click for a range of components, and/or Ctrl+click for multiple components.
- 4. In the Action list, choose Move Sequential.

The Move by ascending Ref Des order has no function when used with the Find dialog box. Components are always added to the pointer in ascending Ref Des order. This feature is only used by the Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace method.

5. Click **OK**.

6. In the dialog box, "Proceed with next object? <value>" click:

- **Yes** to attach parts to the cursor successively, but prompt after every placement to allow you to skip over components if desired
- **Yes to All** if the alphanumeric order of the selection is okay and you do not intend to skip over components.
- **No**  to skip this part, and go to the next.

The first part is attached to the pointer for placement. Parts are attached to the pointer in ascending Ref Des order.

With a part attached to the pointer, you can right-click to access the Rotate 90, Spin mode, Flip, move preferences, and Snap to features and commands. You can also use modeless commands. If a part selected for Move Sequential has a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning dialog box appears informing you of changes you are making to the test point. Test points are locked in the Routing optionson page 1542.

7. Click to place each component, union, or cluster.

### Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace
You select components by either using the Project Explorer or by right-clicking directly in the working area to apply the Move Sequential command. This method places the components on your cursor in the reverse order of your selection order - last component selected is attached to the cursor first.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use one or both of the following methods to select the components:
	- In the Project Explorer with Allow Selectionon page 53 enabled, use Ctrl+click to select multiple components.
	- In the working area, with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components**, **Select Unions/Components**, or **Select Clusters** popup menu item. Using Ctrl+click, select multiple components, unions or clusters.

The parts are attached to the pointer in the order in which they are selected. The first component selected is the first one attached to the pointer. You can override this in a later step.

2. In the working area, right-click and click the **Move Sequential** popup menu item.

**Note:** The Move by ascending Ref Des order can override the order in which you selected the components and place the components on your pointer in ascending Ref Des order.

- 3. In the dialog box, "Proceed with next object? <value>" click:
	- **Yes** to attach parts to the cursor successively, but prompt after every placement to allow you to skip over components if desired
	- **Yes to All** if the alphanumeric order of the selection is okay and you do not intend to skip over components.
	- **No**  to skip this part, and go to the next.

The first part is attached to the pointer for placement. With a part attached to the pointer, you can right-click to access the Rotate 90, Spin mode, Flip, move preferences, and Snap to features and commands. You can also use modeless commands.

You can set the Move preference to select a part by its Origin or Midpoint in the Design optionson page 1503.

Placement uses the current design grid. To place components with a Radial Move, turn on the polar grid on using the GP modeless commandon page 83.

If a part selected for Move Sequential has a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning dialog box appears informing you of changes you are making to the test point. Test points are locked in the Routing optionson page 1542. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

4. Click to place the component.

Use of the Find Dialog Box During Placement

## Modify the Board-Side Location of Components
Use Flip Side to move a part or parts to the opposite side of the board. The flipped part moves to the opposite side in a hinging motion, pivoting on a vertical axis through the part origin.

Text is mirrored so it always appears in the proper orientation. Use Flip Groupon page 488 to flip a component or components around an origin point you specify.

When you flip a component to the opposite side, layer associations change with the component. To turn off moving layer associations with components, set the /NTL switchon page 488 before using Flip Side or Flip Group.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_16_Picture_5.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Use associated copper rather than free copper in decals in the solder or paste mask. Results are unexpected when TrueLayer is on and you use free copper.

Flipping a Component Flipping a Group Use of the /NTL Switch

### Flipping a Component
You can move a component to the opposite side of the board using its origin as the mirror point.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or more components to move to the opposite side.
- 2. Use one of the following:
	- Right-click and click the **Flip Side** popup menu item.
	- Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Component Properties Dialog Box, select the opposite layer in the Layer list.

**Results**

If DRC is on and the system encounters a clearance violation, the flip is canceled. Test points flip with the flipped component.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_16_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip** Use Bottom View for a more realistic view when placing components on the bottom side of the board.

### Flipping a Group
You can move a group of components to the opposite side of the board by specifying the mirrored location.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the components, right-click, then click the **Flip Group** popup menu item.
- 2. Click to indicate the mirror location.

### Use of the /NTL Switch
Layer associations automatically switch with a component when you flip it to another side.

Typically you would want to layer associations to move with the component. For example, you move a surface mounted component to the bottom of the board. The assembly drawing, silkscreen, solder mask and paste mask layer information moves from the top side to the bottom side documentation layers.

If for some special reason, you do not want this to occur, set the /NTL switch before starting SailWind Layout to turn TrueLayer associations off. For more information, see "Software Launch Options".

## Component Arrays
You can arrange parts by creating *arrays*. A component array is a union with members placed on sites of a user-defined matrix.

Component Array Examples Creating a Component Array Modifying a Component Array

### Component Array Examples
You can create either planar arrays or circular arrays.

**Polar Grid or Circular Array**

A number of specific values are utilized in the configuration of a polar grid or circular array.

The figure below shows the different values that you set to create a polar grid or a circular array. In a circular array, components are placed equal distances from each other on one or several rings. By turning on the polar grid and Snap to Grid, you can create drafting items with corners located at the nodes of the polar grid.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_18_Figure_9.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_18_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Planar Array**

A planar array is a union of components that are placed on the intersections of equidistant parallel lines.

The figure below shows the different values that you set to create a planar array. The parallel lines can exist in both the X and Y directions.

**Figure 33. Planar Array**

### Creating a Component Array
You can arrange parts by creating either circular or planar arrays.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the components you want, right-click, then click the **Create Array** popup menu item.
- 2. Click the tab that represents the array you want to create: Planar Array or Circular Array.
- 3. Set the options for the array and click **OK**. A dialog box appears asking you for an array or union name. For more information, see "Component Arrays".
- 4. Type a name for the array or accept the default name and click **OK**. By default, arrays are sequentially named with an ARR\_ prefix; for example, the first array in your design is named ARR\_1, the second array is named ARR\_2, and so on.

The array is created and attaches to your pointer.

You can use Move shortcut menu commands, such as Flip, Spin, and Rotate, while placing the array.

If you move a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

If you try to move a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the move.

5. Click to indicate a location for the array.

### Modifying a Component Array
Using Modify Array, you can rearrange the components in an array after placing it, or you can modify a union.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When modifying a component array:

- You must select Unions in the Selection Filter to select arrays and unions.
- You can only modify one array or union at a time.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an array or union, right-click, then click the **Modify Array** popup menu item.
	- If you are modifying an array, the Modify Array dialog box appears with the tab displayed and the options used to create the array.
	- If you are creating an array from a union, a dialog box appears asking whether to dissolve the union to create an array. Click **Yes** to create the array from the Union. The Create Array dialog box appears.
- 2. Modify array options as necessary.

Modify Array does not enter Move mode as Create Array does.

Modify Array does not warn against nor prevent placement violations unless On-line DRC is in Prevent errors or Warn errors mode.

If you modify the location of an array that contains a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

- 3. Click **OK**. The array is modified or created from the union.
- 4. If On-line DRC is in Prevent errors or Warn errors mode, click to indicate a new position for the modified array.
