## Cluster Placement
With Cluster Placement you can create associations, or groupings, of connected parts.

Cluster Placement works with the following two object types:

- **Unions**  User-created part associations that have a strict relationship with each other.
- **Clusters**  Collections of individual parts, unions, and other clusters, based on connectivity.

**Tip** Autoplacement features ignore components that are part of a physical design reuse.

### Delete a Cluster
You can remove an individual cluster or all clusters.

Remove a Single Cluster Remove All Clusters

#### Remove a Single Cluster
You can remove a single cluster in a design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the cluster. You can make multiple selections.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Break** popup menu item.

#### Remove All Clusters
If desired, you can remove all clusters in the design at once.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select any cluster.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Break All Clusters** popup menu item.

### Collapse Clusters
The "Collapse" command relocates the cluster members to the center of the cluster. The Place Parts process of Cluster Placement eliminates overlaps created when you collapse a cluster.

You can also move each part manually. Collapse operations ignore glued objects or unions containing glued objects.

**Tip** To switch between viewing parts and viewing clusters click the **View > Clusters** menu item.

### Collapsing All Clusters
You can collapse all clusters in the design at one time.

**Procedure**

- 1. With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Clusters** popup menu item.

### Automatic Placement
Use the Cluster Placement dialog box to build new clusters, place clusters within the board outline, and place parts within the board outline.

Preparing for Automatic Placement Placing Parts Automatically

#### Preparing for Automatic Placement
After you create a board outline and import a netlist, SailWind Layout locates all parts at the board origin. You can then prepare your design for automatic placement and begin the automatic placement process.

**Procedure**

- 1. Set the Design Grid to accommodate the parts you want to place. In English units a common grid is 100 or 50 mils for ICs and 50 mils for discrete parts. Start with a grid that is the most common denominator for your ICs.
- 2. Place all parts that should be in a fixed location, such as connectors, mounting holes, and so on. Select these parts.
- 3. Click the **Properties** button.
- 4. Select the Glued check box in the Properties dialog box to prevent Automatic Placement from moving the parts.
- 5. Click the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to move all unglued components outside and around the board outline. Disperse arranges parts around the board outline based on height and length.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_42_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** Disperse ignores components that are part of a physical design reuse.

- 6. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Component Keepout** button to create areas where parts should not be placed during automatic placement.
- 7. Use the **Rotate** and **Flip** buttons to arrange parts that should be placed at an angle or reside on the bottom side of the design.

#### Placing Parts Automatically
As a time-saving option, you can choose to place parts on your PCB design automatically.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Cluster Placement** menu item.
- 2. Click the **Place Parts** button. To modify the automatic placement options, click the **Setup** button (below the Place Parts button). For more information see Place Parts Setup Dialog Box.
- 3. Click **Run**. A status dialog box appears to show placement progress. For more information see "Automatic Placement".

### Cluster Management
Use Cluster Manager to display and manage cluster members and unions. You can move cluster members and unions from one cluster to another and break, or delete, clusters.

Cluster Manager works similarly to the Microsoft Windows Explorer; with it you can view items at the top level or at any level of the hierarchy.

The main elements of the Cluster Manager dialog box are two list boxes showing all clusters, unions, and components that exist in the design.

Adding a Component to a Cluster Making Members of One Cluster Part of Another

#### Adding a Component to a Cluster
If desired, you can add additional components to an existing cluster.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Cluster Manager** menu item.
- 2. In one list box, view the hierarchy of the cluster you want to add to.
- 3. In the other list box, select the components you want to add to the cluster.
- 4. Click the Move **Arrow** button.

#### Making Members of One Cluster Part of Another
If desired, you can merge members of one cluster into another.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Cluster Manager** menu item.
- 2. View the hierarchy of the cluster to add to in either list.
- 3. In the other list, view the hierarchy of the cluster containing the members to merge.
- 4. Highlight the members you want to move.
- 5. Click the Move **Arrow** button.

**Results**

Removing all members from a cluster empties the cluster, but does not delete the cluster name until you click **OK** to end the session. Before clicking **OK**, you can add members to this empty cluster by doubleclicking it and repeating the above steps for the members to add.
