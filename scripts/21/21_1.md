## Placement Strategy
Parts placement depends on multiple factors. In addition to connection length and spacing tolerances, manufacturing considerations such as accessibility for pick-and-place machines and solder treatment

also affect placement. After you determine your manufacturing strategy and import your netlist, use the interactive placement tools to optimize your placement scheme.

Tools to aid in parts placement include:

- Find function that locates and selects parts by reference designator or location
- Separate grid settings for x and y coordinates, set by a modeless command
- Interactive part alignment function
- Nudge interactive parts shoving, with DRC enabled
- Net length minimization
- Connection length minimization
- Automatic and interactive part, pin, and gate swapping
- Automatic part renumbering

## Placement Guidelines
A number of guidelines will aid you in the development of your component placement design.

A good placement scheme:

- Observes all the restrictions placed on component location and trace routing.
- Provides the easiest routing solutions.

Follow this general order for placement:

- 1. Place all components that have a fixed location, such as connectors, ICs that require a specific location, and mounting holes.
- 2. Because of their typically heavy connectivity pattern, connectors need sufficient room between other connectors and the first row of ICs to exit the connector. Allow at least 0.5 mils between the connector and the nearest row of ICs.
- 3. Place components that have engineering restrictions, such as parts that must be a certain distance from each other, parts that cannot be located next to each other, and parts that must be near the connector.
- 4. Place components with no overriding placement requirements. Follow these general guidelines:
- A part's pads should fall on the grid used during autorouting. Some standard increments are 100, 50, 25, 20, 16.67, 12.5, or 10 mils. Set up the design grid before placing components.
- The flow of connections should be vertical and horizontal. Minimize diagonal connections.
- Component pads should line up vertically and horizontally so they do not block routing channels. If two ICs are side by side with their pads staggered 50 mils, the pads of one IC block the routing channels of the other.
- For manufacturing reasons, it is better to have all of the ICs on the board oriented in the same direction, rather than some vertical and some horizontal.

## Component Placement Process
SailWind Layout initially overlays all parts at the origin on the top layer. Before placing components, create a board outline, set up the layers of the design, set the grid values, and set up the clearance design rules—specifically those that apply to component placement.

Many commands are available to place your components. You can:

• Switch to SailWind Router and use it to do all of your placements.

**Restriction:** You cannot use unions, clusters, or reuse items in SailWind Router to assist with placement.

• Click the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to disperse all the components around the board outline.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_2_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** Click the **View > Extents** menu item after you disperse components to bring all design objects into view.

- Move components in the design. For more information, see "Moving Components".
- Orient parts radially on a polar grid. For more information, see "Setting Up a Polar Grid".
- Move multiple components sequentially. For more information, see "Sequential Component  Placement".
- Flip components to the bottom layer. For more information, see "Modify the Board-Side Location of Components, Bottom View".
- Array components. For more information, see "Creating a Component Array".
- Align edges or centerlines of multiple components. For more information, see "Aligning Objects".
- Rotate objects in 90 degree increments or at any angle. For more information, see "Rotating an Object, Spinning an Object".
- Swap the locations of two parts. For more information, see "Swapping Parts".
- Automatically nudge overlapping components into positions that agree with the clearance rules. If you disable design rule checking, you can place parts into positions that disagree with your design rule clearances. For more information, see "Nudge Overlapping Parts".

## Setting the Origin of an Object
Set the origin of an object to move it or place it. You can set the origin of a board outline, 2-D line, decal shape (in the PCB Decal Editor), copper shape, keepout shape, and dimension shape.

You can set the origin of an object using the popup menus when creating a Dimensioning Shape or Drafting Shape.

**Procedure**

1. Select the whole shape.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_3_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** Right-click and click the **Select Shape**, **Select Documentation**, or **Select Board Outline**  popup menu selection shortcuts to select the whole shape. As an alternative, you can press the Shift key and select a segment - this selects the shape rather than a segment or corner.

- 2. Right-click and click the **Set Origin** popup menu item.
- 3. Click to set the new origin point. A message appears to confirm the origin point.
- 4. Click **Yes** to change the origin point or click **No** to use the previous origin point.
- <span id="page-3-1"></span>5. To exit Set Origin mode, press the Esc key.

## Placement and Length Minimization
Before you begin placement, set the topology types you want to use for nets, net classes, or the Default level of the rules hierarchy. *Topology* is the pattern of the trace and the order in which to connect pins in a net. The Length Minimization tool reorders pin connections in a net to support the topology you set.

Length minimization does not change the netlist, it just finds better places to make connections required by the netlist. For example, if you specify the "minimized" topology for a net, length minimization finds the pin order that produces the shortest pin-to-pin connections.

When you move a part around the layout, length minimization happens on the fly. If the topology type is set to something other than "protected," you can see ratsnest connections linking and unlinking pins on the moved part to the nearest viable terminals on other parts. Also, as you move the part, a running measurement called New Length/Old Length appears on the message line. 100 equals 100 percent of all nets connected to the part when you picked it up. If the percentage becomes less than 100, the length is getting better. If the percentage becomes more than 100, the length is getting worse. When you have

a placement you think will work, you can also run length minimization for the entire board by using the Length Minimization command.

Generally, placement that minimizes connection length should be your primary consideration. However, using minimum connection length to determine part location can result in dense areas of connections, usually in the center of the board. These connections can outnumber the routing channels available in the area. Consequently, after you minimize the connection length, study the board to see whether there are critical dense areas. Do not hesitate to make local adjustments to the component locations to spread the connections away from the dense areas.

Part swapping also depends on topology type. No ECO file is required or generated for length minimization or part swapping. On the other hand, gate swapping, pin swapping, and ECL terminator swapping, are all recorded in an ECO file for backward annotation. There may be, however, some highspeed or critical nets in your design for which you want to set to the "protected" topology type before you begin placement.

## Controlling Length Minimization
You can control length minimization by using different methods, each having a distinct effect on the your design environment.

There are two levels of control for length minimization.

- The Length minimize setting in the Design category of the Options dialog box that determines if and when length minimization occurs when moving a component - during a move, or after a move which consumes less display memory.
- The more detailed controls are configured at the Default or a hierarchical rules level, in the Routing Rules dialog box. For more information, see the Routing Rules Dialog Box on page 1666topic.

## Minimizing Unrouted Connection Length
Before you begin placement, consider setting the topology types you want to use. Running a length minimization does not change the netlist; it just finds better places to make the same connections the netlist specifies, based on the topology types you set.

**Procedure**

Click the **Tools > Length Minimization** menu item.

The nets are reordered to minimize the length between connection points.

## Placement Related ECOs
An engineering change order (ECO) is a change in design that either comes to the board from the schematic or occurs in the layout and effects the schematic.

Because ordinary length minimization and part swapping do not change the netlist, you do not need to backward annotate them to the schematic. You must, however, record in an *.eco* file length minimization and placement optimization tools like gate and pin swapping and reference designator renumbering. For this reason, these commands are located on the ECO Toolbar. When you access the ECO Toolbar you are automatically prompted to make this file.

## Use of the Find Dialog Box During Placement
If you imported parts using the *.asc* format, the placement process usually begins with design parts overlaying at the design origin.

<span id="page-5-1"></span>You can use the Find Dialog Boxto break out and select certain parts, or groups of a package type. The dialog box can also attach parts to your pointer for individual placement.

## Component Spacing
SailWind Layout provides automated rules checking to ensure adequate spacing between components.

**Spacing Basics**

The software places components using the units of the Design grid when you enable the snap to grid setting of the Design grid.

The software prevents components from overlapping if you have set up a Body to body Clearanceon page 1167 rule and the Online DRCon page 1503 (design rule checking) is in Prevent errors mode.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_5_Figure_10.jpeg)

The preceding illustration shows examples of how some of the design clearance rules are interpreted by DRC in various design situations.

During placement operations (with Online DRC enabled), the system examines the design rules for the component being placed and compares them against other design objects including other components, the board outline and board cutouts.

All of the design rules are equally and separately enforced. If values are specified for each of the design clearance rules, then they are individually checked. During placement operations (with Online DRC enabled), the system does not allow a part to be placed if any design clearance rule is in violation of its specified value.

Typically, when a component is moved into the proximity of another component, the system will check the following design rules (if values are assigned):

- Body/Layer 20 (placement) outline against other body/Layer 20 (placement) outlines
- Body/Layer 20 (placement) outline against board outline or board cutout(s)
- Pad/SMD to Pad/Via/SMD/Trace/Copper/Text/Board/Drill clearances (with full rules hierarchy support)
- Pad and SMD Same Net clearances (with full rules hierarchy support)

The component body is considered to be the furthest extent of any 2D line object on the following layers:

- Component layer (top or bottom)
- Associated silkscreen layer for component layer (silkscreen top or bottom)
- All Layers/Layer 0 (zero).

There is only one "Body to body" clearance value that must apply to all components.

**Body-to-Body Checking Rules**

The "Body to body" check has specific rules associated with it during placement operations with DRC enabled:

- If the body outline encounters another body outline, and no other clearance violations exist, then the "Body to body" rule is applied.
- SailWind Layout does not have a "Body to Pad/SMD" design rule, therefore, in a situation where a component body/Layer 20 (placement) outline is in proximity to the TH or SMD pads of another component, the "Body to body" clearance value is used during checking as the minimum target clearance value between the TH/SMD pads and the component body/Layer 20 (placement) outline.
- If the TH or SMD pads of a component are in proximity to the TH or SMD pads of another component, and the component body/Layer 20 (placement) outlines of the components do not violate the "Body to body" clearance value, then the system enforces the corresponding Pad/SMD to Pad/Via/SMD/Trace/Copper/Text/Board/Drill clearances (with full rules hierarchy support).

DRC checks the "Body to body" spacing between:

- Component body outline to component body outline
- Layer 20 outline to Layer 20 outline
- Component body outline to Layer 20 outline

The software references the "Body to body" measurement from the edges of the 2D lines that define the body of the components.

**Advanced Spacing**

While a single "Body to body" clearance may suit many of your components, you may have many parts that require extra spacing, for the pick and place process, or for rework.

You can create a custom clearance outline in the decal on Layer 20. The software uses this larger placement outline, called a "component courtyard" or "nudge outline", during the placement process to create more spacing around components. The software considers the Layer 20 (placement) outline as part of the component body. Whenever it is encountered, the "Body to body" clearance rule is invoked.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_7_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** In extended layers modeon page 315, Layer 20 becomes Layer 120.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_7_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Collision Prevention**

If you set the Nudge option to "automatic" or "prompt", when you attempt to overlap parts, the component either nudges automatically or you are prompted for the direction to move the component away from the one you are placing.

If you disable Nudge and turn off the Online DRC during placement, as a post-process, you can nudge all offending components with the **Tools** menu > **Nudge Components** command, but you have no control over the offending components and where they move.

You can create arrays of parts that automatically space rows and columns of components by values that you supply using the Create Array Dialog Box.

**Spacing Verification**

If you are unsure if components have been placed outside of the design rules that you have set up, you can run a clearance check (click the **Verify Design > Clearance** menu item). Be sure that all aspects of your components, including the outline color for Layer 20 are visible since the clearance check only verifies objects that are visible and within view during its checking routine.

In the Clearance Checking Setupon page 1164, select the check box for the following:

- Body to body to check for the "Body to body" clearance value between component bodies.
- Placement Outline to check for the "Body to body" clearance value between the Layer 20 outlines

**Note:**

If you select both the Body to body and the Placement outline checks, the system also checks for clearance violations between the component body outlines and the Placement (Layer 20) outlines.

## Moving Components
You can move components as required to optimize part placement.

**Procedure**

- 1. Attach the component(s) to your pointer using one of the following methods:
	- On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Design Toolbar** button to display the Design Toolbar. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Move**, and then select a component. You can only move one component at a time.
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move and drag the component(s) to the desired location. The Drag moves optionon page 1531 must be set to Drag and attach or Drag and drop. For more information, see "Drag Moves area of the Global > General optionson page 1531".
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move, right-click and click **Move**.
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move and on the Design Toolbar, click the **Move** button.

If you move a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

When you move a group, an error may appear in a Trace Copy Dialog Box.

If you try to move a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the move.

2. The component attaches to your pointer according to the Move preference optionon page 1503.

**Tip**

While the component is attached to the cursor, you can right-click and click commands like **Rotate 90**, **Spin**, **Flip Side**, change the Move preference, activate Snapping to objectson page 1540, or set the On-line DRCon page 1503 to ignore clearance rules. Use Bottom View for a more realistic view when placing components on the bottom side of the board.

- 3. To place the component, use one of the following methods:
	- Move the pointer to the new location and click to place the component.
	- Use one of the S Modeless Commandsto proceed to a specific coordinate. Press the Spacebar key to place the component. This substitutes a mouse click that could move the pointer off the coordinate that you specified.

## Moving Items With Move by Origin
When you select several objects at once, you can use different origins for the move.

<span id="page-9-1"></span>If you select Move by Origin in the Design category of the Options dialog box, the pointer snaps to the center of the group, calculated from the extents of the group, and uses it as the origin for the move.

## Moving Items With Stretch Traces During Component Move
When you select a component with partial traces connected to the pins of the component, the traces stretch to remain connected to the pins as long as you have "Stretch traces during component move" selected in the Design category of the Options.

Each trace connected to a pin of the moving component connects to the new pin position. If DRC is off, straight-line segments are added. If DRC is on, traces are rerouted with smoothed patterns using AutoRoute. When "Stretch traces during component move" is not selected, unroutes are created between the tacks of the trace connections.

## Moving Design Objects Radially
Use Radial Move to adjust the orientation of objects. This command supports creation of circular decals and circular boards. You can also use Radial Move with text and reference designators.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You must set up a Polar Gridon page 352.
- In the PCB Decal Editor, you can only use Radial Move with terminals.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select single or multiple components or unions. In the PCB Decal Editor, select single or multiple terminals.
- 2. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Design Toolbar** button to display the Design Toolbar.
- 3. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Radial Move** button. The status bar displays the current polar radius and polar angle position in addition to the angular and radial increments.

**Tip** You can alternately move design objects radially using verb mode. First, on the Design Toolbar, click the **Radial Move** button and then select the desired design object(s) to move. This method will keep the Radial Move command active and allow you to repeat the operation again after you have finished moving you first selection(s).

4. If you did not previously set up the polar grid to match your design requirements, click the **Tools > Options** menu item, select the **Grids** category, then click **Radial Move Setup**. The Radial Move Setup dialog box appears. For more information, see "Radial Move Setup Dialog Box".

Set up the polar grid and move options and click **OK**. SailWind Layout saves these settings to apply to any future use of Radial Move in the current session.

The polar grid appears and the selected objects attach to the pointer.

- 5. Move the selected objects to an eligible site.
- 6. Click to indicate a location on the polar grid for the selected objects.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_10_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** When you exit Radial Move, the polar grid is turned off. Use the GP modeless command on page 83 to turn the polar grid on and off independently of Radial Move.

**Examples**

Placing or moving parts on a radial grid utilizes a slightly different approach than that of the standard x/y grid. Examples will illustrate the behavior of the placement and move commands when using the polar grid.

The following graphic shows an example polar grid definition.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 31. An Example Polar Grid Definition**

The following table shows the Radial Move settings used to create the polar grid in the figure above.
