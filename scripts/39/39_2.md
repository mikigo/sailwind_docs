## DFF, Design For Fabrication
To support fabrication design rules, SailWind Layout provides fabrication checks with Verify Design. This functionality, called DFF Audit (Design For Fabrication) , lets you either check for fabrication errors within SailWind Layout or backward annotate errors from the CAM product, CAM350. DFF Audit detects potential errors in a design, so that you can identify these problems prior to board fabrication.

The checking within SailWind Layout uses the CAM document definitions to determine if fabrication errors exist. The CAM documents determine the photoplotter output and include layer composites, oversize, suppression, and other masking preferences. All electrical layers are analyzed to check acid traps and copper sliver fabrication. To check mask sliver and solder mask bridge fabrication, the solder mask layers are analyzed. To check silkscreen over pads, silkscreen layers are compared to solder mask layers.

Design for Fabrication Workflow Process Flow for Using DFF Audit DFF Audit Process Flow using CAM350 Link

### Design for Fabrication Workflow
Design For Fabrication is best accomplished using a structured workflow to define the various steps of the process.

The table below shows the basic workflow for auditing your design for fabrication.

## Exporting to CAM350
You can translate a SailWind Layout design using CAM350 Link. This allows you to perform additional design analysis on your design in the CAM350 environment.

**Prerequisites**

You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.

- 1. Create a SailWind Layout design.
- 2. Click the **File> Export** menu item, and in the Save as type list, click CAM350 and then click **Save**. The CAM350 dialog box appears.
- 3. Choose a mode to either create the CAM350 *.cam* file only, or create the file and automatically launch CAM350.
- 4. In the Layer Options area, select an option for the amount of PADS design detail to translate to the CAM350 database.
- 5. Arcs in polygon shapes, such as copper planes, are approximated using straight edges. In the Arc Approximation Tolerance box, type the minimum allowable distance between the actual arc path and the approximated straight-line segments. This appears in the appropriate design units, which you set on the Options dialog box > **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 6. In the CAM350 File Name box, type a *.cam* path and file name or click Browse to navigate to a location.

The default file name and path are the same name as the current design file name and path.

- 7. Click **OK**.
- 8. Run your manufacturing process in CAM350.

**Results**

Once the design file is in CAM350, you can perform DFM analysis on the design. If DFM errors exist, you can back-annotateon page 889 the errors to SailWind Layout to identify and correct them. Subsequently, you can generate a new CAM350 database and verify that all DFM errors have been corrected. You can then create CAM outputs in either SailWind Layout or CAM350.

The processing routines that translate SailWind Layout data into CAM350 *.cam* files detect errors and warnings and report them to the standard SailWind Layout error file (*Layout.err*).

## Working with Markups
You can use markups to define and document specific issues related to your design. This lets you notate design concerns and easily share them with associates or downstream process personnel.

### Adding Markups
Use the Markups dialog box to log issues concerning the design. You can add 2D line markups to issues in order to outline or highlight their location. You can also link design objects to markups.

**Prerequisites**

You must create at least one topic section to begin adding issues and 2D line markups.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Markups** menu item.
- 2. Click the **Add Topic** button to add a topic.

For example, as you review the design for another designer, you spot several silkscreen placement issues. You could name the markup topic - Silkscreen.

3. Click the **Add Issue** button to add an issue.

For example, your first issue could be the placement of a reference designator beneath a component. You could name the markup issue - Placement of R54 refdes.

- 4. Click the **Add Markup** button.
- 5. Right-click and choose your options before adding the 2D line.

**Restriction:**

Line widths or the layer location of your 2D line markers are not maintained when exporting and re-importing.

6. Draw a 2D line to highlight the area of concern.

For example, you could draw a rectangle around the offending refdes.

- 7. You can also link design itemson page 881 to the markup.
- 8. Save the markups by choosing one of the following:
- Click the **Export** button in the Markups dialog box to export the markups into a *.cle* encrypted collaboration file.
- Click the **File> Save as** menu item to generate a snapshot of the design and create a *.cle* file to match it.

**Note:** The markups are not saved when you click the **File> Save** menu item (or the **Save**  button on the dialog box, or Ctrl+S).

**Results**

- Issues are logged against the design and ready to be shared.
- Markups take the color of 2D lines on any given layer.
