## Design for Test
To support In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures, SailWind Layout's DFT Audit can help you manage in-circuit test points. Using parameters that you set, DFT Audit can analyze all nets in the design, automatically assign test point attributes to the appropriate vias and component pins on accessible (adaptable) nets, add test points to adaptable nets that are already routed, and report inaccessible (nonadaptable) nets.

For non-adaptable nets, DFT Audit can add test point vias and place them outside the board outline. These capabilities help you consider ICT early in the design process, improving your productivity by reducing potential iterations of a manual DFT Audit.

To manually assign a component pin or via as a test point, you add a test point setting to the object. A test point can be one pin of a multiple pin component, the only pin of a single test point component, or a via.

DFT Audit assigns vias and component pins as test points rather than adding several single pin components. Therefore, you avoid backward annotation of test point information to the schematic. For more information, see "Test Point Definition".

When you run DFT Audit, SailWind Layout automatically transfers the design to SailWind Router. Using parameters that you set in SailWind Layout, SailWind Router analyzes all nets for adaptability and adds test points to routed adaptable nets. Note that SailWind Router may reroute nets during DFT Audit. When SailWind Router is done, it transfers the design back to SailWind Layout. For nets that SailWind Router determines to be non-adaptable, SailWind Layout can optionally add test points, which are placed outside the board edge. When DFT Audit finishes, the DFT Audit Board Report appears.

To access the DFT Audit, click DFT Audit on the Tools menu. For information about running DFT Audit, see the Performing a Test Point Audit topic.

**Restriction:**

DFT Audit tolerates slotted holes, but does not test them for adaptability.

While you can run DFT Audit in either SailWind Layout or SailWind Router, the dialog box used to set a DFT Audit option depends on the program you are running. For more information, see "Mapping SailWind Layout DFT Audit Settings to SailWind Router".

### Compare Test Points
Use Compare Test Points to compare test point settings in ASCII format, between the current file and another file.

1. You need an ASCII file of test points from an older version of the design file.

For more information, see "Creating a Test Point ASCII File".

- 2. Click the **Tools > Compare Test Points** menu item to open the Compare Test Points dialog box.
- 3. Locate or type the name of the ASCII test point file to compare against.

You do not need to type the *.asc* extension.

4. Click **OK**. SailWind Layout creates an internal ASCII test point list of the open file and compares it to the one you specified.

If the ASCII file you compare against is a version earlier than PowerPCB 2.x, or if a test point section is not present in the ASCII file, an error message appears. Create another file to compare against.

When differences exist, the output error file *tpasc.lst* opens listing the differences.

### Creating a Test Point ASCII File
You can create an ASCII test point list in an older design format.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the *.pcb* file in SailWind Layout.
- 2. Click the **File> Export** menu item to open the File Export dialog box.
- 3. Type a name in the File name box.
- 4. Click **Save** and the ASCII Output dialog box appears.
- 5. Click the PowerPCB V3.0 Format from the list.
- 6. Click Current from the Units list.
- 7. Click **Select All** to select all check boxes.
- 8. Click **OK**.

### Performing a Test Point Audit
Use DFT (Design For Test) Audit to manage test points used to support In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures. Test points help you meet your ICT requirements early in the design process and can improve your productivity by reducing design iterations.

When you run DFT Audit, SailWind Layout automatically transfers the design to SailWind Router. Using options you set in SailWind Layout, SailWind Router analyzes all nets for accessibility and adds test points to routed accessible nets. Note that SailWind Router may reroute nets during DFT Audit. When SailWind Router is done, it transfers the design back to SailWind Layout. For nets that SailWind Router determines to be inaccessible, SailWind Layout can optionally add test points, which are placed outside the board edge. When DFT Audit finishes, the DFT Audit Board Report appears.

**Prerequisites**

- SailWind Router must be installed and licensed for you to run DFT Audit in SailWind Layout. You can run DFT Audit regardless of the layer limits in the SailWind Router license.
- If you are using BGAs, fan out the BGAs before running DFT Audit.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item.
- 2. On the DFT Audit dialog box, click the tab for which you want to modify the test point placement options and properties:
	- Optionson page 866
	- Propertieson page 867
	- Assignmenton page 868
- 3. Modify the properties on the tab as required.
- 4. Click **Run**. The automatic audit process starts.

### Placing Test Points
Several options for placing test points are available to you on the **Options** tab of the DFT Audit dialog box. Choose the options that best fit the requirements of your current design.

**Tip** To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Options** tab.
- 2. Define how test points are created using options in the Create test points area.

You can preserve existing via properties and add test point vias to routed, accessible nets.

- 3. Set probe via test point properties using options in the Probe through area.
- 4. Place via test points on a grid using options in the Place via points using area.
- 5. Specify test point nail diameters using options in the Available Nail Diameters area.
- 6. Set minimum pad areas using options in the Minimum Pad Probing Sizes area.

Set minimum pad probing sizes for both vias and component pins to ensure that there is sufficient pad area for probe contact.

**Tip**

To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Properties** tab.
- 2. Specify the minimum distances between the probe and other design objects using options in the Probe Minimum Distances area.

**Tip** The clearances needed between a probe and another design object are mostly based on the physical constraints of the Automated Test Equipment (ATE) used by In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures. The probes extending out of the ATE fixture must make contact with the PCB without interference from any obstacles. This means that test points must keep a fixed distance from component bodies, pads, mounting holes, and the board edge, and must also have the minimum spacing between them.

- 3. Specify the maximum length of trace stubs required to make a net accessible to a test probe by typing the length into the Stub Length box.
- 4. Specify zero or more than one nail pins on a net using options in the Multiple Test Point Nets area.

By default, all nets are set to receive one probe, or nail pin. If you do not want any nail pins on a net, double-click the Nail Pins cell for the net and type zero (0). If you want to change the number of nail pins for a net to receive, in the Multiple Test Point Nets area, type the new value in the Nail Pins cell for the net.

To display only nets with no nail pin or with more than one nail pin, select the Show Only Nets with Nail Pins Not Equal to One check box.

To sort the list by a different column, click the column header at the top of the list.

### Setting Test Point Assignment Eligibility
Use the **Assignment** tab to prevent or favor assigning test points to components or to via types. By default, all pins on a net are available for test pin assignment and are evenly weighted as test point candidates.

**Tip** To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Assignment** tab.
- 2. To prevent use as a test point, select the Exclude check box.
- 3. To favor use as a test point, select the Prefer check box.
- 4. To apply even weighting, clear the Exclude and Prefer check boxes.

To change the check box value for multiple rows, select the rows and then click a check box.

To sort the spreadsheet by a specific column, click that column's header.

### Probing the PCB Top Side Only
You can restrict test point probing to the PCB top side only. This is useful for preparing a test setup when physical restrictions exist that will not let you access the bottom of the board during testing.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create a test point keepouton page 465 on the bottom side of the board.
- 2. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item to open the DFT Audit dialog box.
- 3. Click the Optionson page 866 tab.
- 4. In the Probe through area, select the Probe Top Side check box.
- 5. Click **Run**.

**Results**

DFT Audit ignores the bottom side because it has a test point keepout defined. Only the top side of the PCB is probed.

### Modifying a Jumper Pin that is a Locked Test Point
When modifying or moving a jumper pin that is a locked test point, a message is presented indicating that the object is locked and you will be required to confirm your design intent.

**Procedure**

You will be modifying a locked test point in one of the following ways:

- If you are modifying the pad stack of a jumper pin that is a locked test point, the "One of the jumper pins is locked as a test point. Do you want to apply the changes to jumper?" message appears. Click one of the following:
	- **Yes** Applies the change and maintains the locked test point status.
	- **No**  Cancels the change.
- If you move a jumper pin that is a locked test point, the "Via marked as Test Point. Proceed Anyway?" message appears. Click one of the following:
	- **Disable Lock Test Points** Turns the Lock Test Points check box off in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542.
	- **OK**  Allows you to move the jumper pin and maintain the test point status; the jumper pin is locked in its new position.
	- **Cancel**  Cancels the move.

### Modifying a Pin that is a Locked Test Point
When modifying a pin that is a locked test point, a message will presented indicating that the object is locked and you will be required to confirm your design intent.

**Procedure**

You will be modifying a pin that is a locked test point in one of the following ways:

- If you are modifying the pad stack of a component pin, the "Do you want to apply the changes to all components with decal type xxx or just the selected components?" message appears. Click one of the following:
	- **All** Applies the change to all decal types.
	- **Selected** Applies the change to the selected decal.
	- **Cancel** Cancels the change.
- If the component pin is a locked test point, the "Include locked test points in Pad Stack update?" message appears when you click All or Selected. Click one of the following:
	- **Yes** Applies the change and maintains the locked test point status.
	- **No**  Cancels the change.

### Modifying a Route Attached to a Locked Test Point
When modifying a route that is attached to a locked test point, a message will presented indicating that the object is locked and you will be required to confirm your design intent.

**Procedure**

If you attempt to move or modify a route that is attached to a via that is a locked test point, the "Command causes the move of Via(s) marked as Test Point(s). Continue command ignoring Test Points or keep them locked during modification of route?" message appears. Click one of the following:

- **Disable Lock Test Points** Turns the Lock Test Points check box off in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542.
- **OK**  Performs the modification and moves the via along with the route, ignoring the locked test point setting. The test point will be locked again in its new position.
- **Keep Locked**  Performs the modification but does not move the via; the locked test point location is maintained. You can modify the route, but the test point via does not move.
- **Cancel**  Cancels the modification.

### Modification of a Via or Virtual Pin That is a Locked Test Point
When modifying a via or a virtual pin that is a locked test point, you can choose to modify the pad stack, or assign a different via type.

#### Modifying the Pad Stack of a Via or Virtual Pin That Is a Locked Test Point
When modifying the pad stack of a via or virtual pin that is a locked test point, a message will presented indicating that the object is locked and you will be required to confirm your design intent.

**Procedure**

You are modifying the pad stack of a locked test point in one of the following ways:

- If you modify the pad stack of a via or virtual pin in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box, the "Are you sure you want to change all vias of type xxx?" message appears. Click one of the following:
	- **Yes** applies the change.
	- **No**  cancels the change.
- If the via/virtual pin is a locked test point, the "Include locked test points in Pad Stack update?" message appears. Click one of the following:
	- **Yes** Applies the change and maintains the locked test point status.
	- **No**  For vias, cancels the change. For virtual pins, the change is made (that is, as though Yes had been selected).

**Results**

If you do not include test points in the update, then the pad stacks for the test points are preserved by renaming them with a TP\_ prefix; for example, changing the pad stacks for STANDARDVIA, the test point pad stack is renamed TP\_STANDARDVIA.

#### Assigning a Different Via Type To a Via That Is a Locked Test Point
When assigning a different via type to a via that is a locked test point, a message will presented indicating that the object is locked and you will be required to confirm your design intent.

If you assign a different via type to a via that is a locked test point, by selecting a new Via Name in the Via Properties dialog box, the "Command causes change of via type for Via(s) marked as Test Point. Proceed Anyway?" message appears. Click one of the following:

- **Disable Lock Test Points** Turns the Lock Test Points check box off in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542.
- **OK**  Applies the change and maintains the test point status.
