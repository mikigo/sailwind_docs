**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the High Speed option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. In the Electrodynamic Check dialog box, click the **Parameters** button.

You must have specified your plane layers in the Layers Setup Dialog Boxbefore you run an electrodynamic check. For a two-layer board, temporarily identify one of the layers as a plane layer.

5. For each dielectric material layer, double-click the Type cell to select whether the "layer" is a Prepreg or Substrate layer.

Although it is a longer process, you can click a box and then click Edit instead of using the doubleclick method.

6. For each layer, double-click the Thickness cell and type a value.

If no coating is required, set thickness to zero.

7. For dielectric material layers, double-click the Dielectric cell and type a dielectric constant value.

You can view and edit copper thicknesses by weight or design units. Click the copper thickness unit you want:

- Weight (oz) Weight of copper in ounces, per square foot
- Design Units Same unit of measure as the current database unit of measure

### Plane Checking Setup
Use the Mixed Plane Setup dialog box to set the type of Plane checking.

Checking Thermal Connectivity Only Checking Clearance and Net Connectivity Checking Same Layer Connectivity

#### Checking Thermal Connectivity Only
You can check your design for split/mixed or CAM plane thermal connectivity. Use this check to find pins or vias that do not have the thermal attribute set, or to find pins that are not within a plane area (thermals will not connect). You can set the thermal attribute in Jumper Pin, Pin, or Via Properties dialog boxes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Plane option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Click "Check thermal connectivity only".
- 4. Click **OK**.
- 5. Click **Start** in the Verify Design dialog box to run the check.

#### Checking Clearance and Net Connectivity
You can check your design for split/mixed plane clearance and net connectivity errors. If the split/mixed plane is not connected in the design, the plane will be flooded before the check is run.

**Prerequisites**

Before you check for clearance and net connectivity, a plane area for each net assigned to the plane layer in the Layers Setup Dialog Boxmust be present.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Plane option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Click **Check clearance and connectivity**.
- 4. Click **OK**.
- 5. Click **Start** in the Verify Design dialog box to run the check.

**Tip** Pads on plane layers are checked for plating, a pad size on a plane layer that is greater than the drill size plus the drill oversize, or connection to a plane net.

#### Checking Same Layer Connectivity
Ensures that plane areas are continuous on the split/mixed plane layer. Plane areas of a particular net must have copper contact with each other without going to another layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Plane option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Click Check clearance and connectivity.
- 4. Select the Same Layer Connectivity check box.

### Check the Plane Connection for Continuity
When you run a continuity check in Verify Design, the net checks are connected if no errors are found.

Run the Plane check to see whether a pad exists in the connecting pad stack for the plane level, for example; is the pad size more than 0 or does the drill size exceed pad size? For links to SMD pads, it checks whether the pad-to-via connection connects to the plane.
