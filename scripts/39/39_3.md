#### Reading Error Details
Error results for a type of check are listed in the Location box. Listed errors, contain their (X,Y) location, layer, and error type.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. Select an error from the list.

The explanation for the error appears in the Explanation box.

- 3. View the more specific, detailed information about the error selected in the Location list including information about any conflicting object.
- 4. Click **Close** when you are finished with the Verify Design dialog box.

The current error list remains whether the dialog box is open or closed. The error markers remain until you click Clear Errors, which clears the markers, not the errors.

#### Viewing Errors in the Design
You can view error markers in the design. Error markers in the workspace indicate the error type.

**Prerequisites**

Colors must be assigned properly in the Display Colors dialog box in order to see error markers. Errors in the design area appear in the color of the Errors check boxes per layer of the Display Colors dialog box. When an error is selected in the Location box, the error in the design area appears in the Highlight color.

**Procedure**

1. You open the Verify Design database to perform a design check and generate a list of any errors occurring in your design.

See "Running a Design Check"on page 883 for instructions.

- 2. With the "Verify Design dialog box" on page 1775 still open, select an error from the Location list.
- 3. The design window pans to the area of the error (unless you select Disable Panning first).

The pan to the area of the area is more obvious if you are zoomed into your design.

**Tip** You can prevent the design area from panning to errors when you select them if you select the Disable Panning check box in the Verify Design dialog box.

The generated error list remains whether the dialog box is open or closed. If you close the dialog box, you can view the list in the error report file. You can access the report file by clicking the link that appears in the Output window.

**Note:** Error markers are not erased from the design until you click **Clear Errors** which clears the error markers, not the actual errors. You must correct the error in the design.

#### Interpreting Error Markers
After verifying the design, error markers are inserted in a SailWind Layout database as database objects. Error objects present in a SailWind Layout database transfer into SailWind Router and are converted into SailWind Router error objects during file load.

**Tip** Within SailWind Router you can assign an error as ignored. An ignored error status makes the error marker invisible but leaves the error in the database. SailWind Layout supports storage of the ignored status on errors; however, ignored status can only be assigned or unassigned within SailWind Router. In SailWind Layout, ignored errors are not invisible. Ignored errors invisible in SailWind Router saved to a SailWind Layout file will be visible when the file is loaded into SailWind Layout. But ignored errors remain as ignored after a file is saved in SailWind Layout and loaded SailWind Router.

Most error objects in SailWind Layout are converted to an identical SailWind Router error object. The exceptions to these conversions are listed in the Notes column of the table below.

### Troubleshoot Design Verify Errors
There are different types of errors such as clearance errors, subnet errors and untied plane pin errors. Interpreting them correctly will help you clear them from the design quickly.

**Clearance Errors**

Clearance errors can report a Same net clearance error with an error explanation of Distance between pads too small.

Although there is no specific SMD-to-SMD and SMD-to-Pad clearances, the SMD-to-Via clearance rule is used.

**Subnet Errors**

Connectivity checks often report a subnet error.

There are several causes of subnet errors:

- **An unassigned net**  the net is not assigned to the plane area. Open the properties of the plane area shapeon page 1328 and ensure that a net is assigned to the shape. You can only assign a net while the shape is in outline mode.
- **A small unroute**  turn off all layers in the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box. Assign a bright color to Connections and search the design for unroutes.

**Tip**

You might find a connection to a pin that is not fully routed to the center of the pad. It's also easier to spot these if you assign a different color between pads and traces and enable the transparent mode to see the trace "underneath" the pad.

- **An unplated component pin**  check the pad stacks propertieson page 1566 of the component pin and ensure the Plated check box is selected.
- **A via or pad without a plane thermal**  open the Via Properties on page 1779 or Pin Propertieson page 1632 dialog box and ensure the Plane Thermal check box is selected.

A Full Plane Check with Same Layer Connectivity Check will also display a subnet error which is caused only by isolated planes. For more information, see "Plane Checking Setup".

**Untied Plane Pin Errors**

Plane checks sometimes report untied plane pin errors.

There are a few causes of untied plane pin errors:

- An unplated pin or via
- A pin with a pad size on a plane layer that is greater than the drill size plus the drill oversize
- A pin without the thermal attribute set

### Saving and Printing Error Results
You can print error results, or alternatively, view the current error results in your default text editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. To view the most recently run report results in the default text editor, click **View Report**. You can print or save the results from your default text editor.

**Related Topics**

Setting Default Report File Names

### Setting Default Report File Names
When you run a Verify Design check, a report file is created with a unique name for each check type.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. To specify the default file name of each report type click **Report File**.

This opens the Save As dialog box where you can name the report that you will run, if you do not want to use the default reference name for the report type.

If you do not give the report a unique name, it is always saved to the default file name.

### Previewing Fabrication Errors in CAM files
After you run a Fabrication check that reports errors, you can preview the CAM layer document associated with the error. The Preview button is available only when fabrication checking is enabled and lists errors.

**Prerequisites**

You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. Select an error in the Location box.
- 3. Click **Preview**.

**Results**

The CAM Preview Dialog Boxopens.

**Tip** Since error markers are not added to the CAM document, it helps to zoom into the design area before you click Preview. If the CAM Preview does not open zoomed into the same area, you can click the Workspace button in the Cam Preview window to match the workspace view.

**Note:**

In the CAM Preview window, click **Setup** to change the preview settings of the specified document in the preview area.

### Back-annotating CAM350 Files
Backward annotation begins by parsing the specified CAM350 file for DFM errors. For each error listed in the file an error marker is added to the SailWind Layout database, at the error location.

**Prerequisites**

- You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.
- Existing DFM error markers in the SailWind Layout database are cleared before the CAM350 file is parsed.

**Procedure**

- 1. Perform DFM error analysis in CAM350 and save the file.
- 2. Open the design file in SailWind Layout.
- 3. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 4. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, choose the Fabrication option.
- 5. Click **Setup**.
- 6. In the Fabrication Checking Setup Dialog Boxchoose the Annotate DFF Errors option.
- 7. Type the name or browse for the CAM350 file in which DFM errors were saved.
- 8. Click **Start** in the Verify Design dialog box. DFM error markerson page 885 appear wherever errors exist in the design. They also appear in the Location list with their location.
- 9. Correct existing errors and regenerate the CAM350 database.

### Adding Nets or Classes for Specific High-Speed Checks
You can run specific electrodynamic checks on nets or classes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the High Speed option.
- 3. Click **Setup**, then click **Add Nets** or **Add Classes**.
- 4. Select a net or class and then click **OK**.

**Tip**

You can select more than one item using Ctrl+click. You can select a range using Shift +click or by dragging the cursor.

### Setting Up Clearance Checking
Use the Clearance Checking Setup dialog box to specify which clearances to check during a Clearance verification.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Clearance checks are only applied to design objects that are visible in the workspace view at your current zoom level and only those design objects with their colors are turned on. If you are zoomed in or have objects turned off, they are ignored by the clearance check.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Clearance checking only checks the visible area of the design.
- Reference designator, part type, and attribute labels are not checked for clearance violations.
- Clearance checking does not check against 2D lines.
- Clearance checking is not performed on CAM Planes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Clearance option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the check box beside any types of clearance checks you want to enable and then click **OK**.

Design Rule Hierarchy

### Setting Up Checking for Isolated Stitching Vias
During design verification, you can use the Connectivity Check to report isolated routing vias and isolated stitching vias.

(An isolated stitching via is a stitching via that is not connected to any hatch outline or copper area.) However, to have the check report isolated stitching vias, you must first set it up to ignore connections to CAM planes.

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Connectivity option and then click **Setup**.
- 3. In the Connectivity Checking Setup dialog box, select the Ignore CAM plane connection for isolated stitching vias check box and click **OK**.

**Results**

When you verify the design, the checking operation reports isolated stitching vias as errors and marks them in the design, along with the other errors found during checking.

### Setting Up Latium Checking
Latium checking performs advanced design checking using the Latium technology contained with SailWind Router.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Latium Design Verification option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the "Net to All" check box to check clearance rules on each net or hierarchical level against any other obstacle type.
- 4. Select the Board Outline check box to check clearance rules for the board outline and board cut outs.
- 5. Select the Off Board Text check box to check for off-board text and to flag all instances of off-board text as clearance errors.
- 6. Select the Keepout check box to check for keepout restriction violations.
- 7. Select the Same Net check box to check clearances between objects along the same net, as specified in the Clearance Rules dialog box.

For more information, see "Design Rule Hierarchy".

8. Select the Drill to Drill check box to check clearances between all drill holes. Pad stack drill size plus the drill oversize value calculate the diameter for plated holes.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_31_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** Drill to drill errors are reported for only one layer in a drill pair.

9. Select the Trace Width check box to check traces in excess of minimum and maximum widths, specified in the Clearance Rules dialog box.

For more information, see "Design Rule Hierarchy".

10. Select the Placement Outline check box to check outline against outline with the following considerations:

- In default layer mode, check outline against outline on layer 20, not on electrical layers.
- In increased layer mode, check outline against outline on layer 120.

**Tip**

You can create outlines on layer 20 (or 120) that do not exactly match the actual component outline. By setting a larger outline on this layer, you can leave an area near a component open for other purposes. This check ensures this area is left open.

11. Select the Via at SMD check box to check for via at SMD restriction violations.

For more information, see "Pad Entry Rules Dialog Box".

12. Select the Differential Pairs check box to check for differential pair restriction violations.

For more information, see "Creating Differential Pair Design Rules".

13. Select the Trace Length check box to check for length restriction violations.

For more information, see "HiSpeed Rules Dialog Box".

14. Select the Test Point check box to check test points on the design.

Test Points checks for probe clearances, minimum via/pad sizes for probing, SMD pin probing, test points on component pin on the component side, test point count per net settings and nail diameter settings, and compares the settings against the setting in the DFT Audit program. For more information, see "Performing a Test Point Audit".

**Results**

Latium design checks are performed with the following restrictions:

- Reference designator, part type, and attribute labels are not checked for clearance violations.
- Latium design verification performs clearance checking on only the visible area of the design. When clearance checking against the board outline, the edge of the object is checked against the centerline of the board outline.
- Drill to Drill errors are reported for only one layer in a drill pair.
- Test point checking is the same whether you enable the checking on the Latium Checking Setup dialog box or on the Verify Design dialog box. If you plan to perform Latium design verification, you can eliminate an extra design transfer between SailWind Layout and SailWind Router by running test point checking with the other Latium checks.
