Acid Traps Slivers Solder Bridges Starved Thermals Annular Ring Silkscreen Over Pads Trace Width/Pad Size

#### Acid Traps
An acid trap is a location where, due to the surface tension of the etching, acid gets trapped in an area. This acid causes over-etching, which hurts yield. The acid trap runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

<span id="page-34-3"></span>Acid Trap Maximum Size indicates the maximum size of the acid traps to flag. The area of pools that are flagged will be less than this value \(Figure 119).

**Figure 119. Acid Trap Maximum Size**

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_34_Picture_8.jpeg)

<span id="page-34-4"></span>Acid Trap Maximum Angle is an angle from 1 to 89 degrees. Any copper items (traces, pads, or any other objects that exist on the layer) that form an angle smaller than this are flagged as an acid trap (Figure 120\).

**Figure 120. Acid Trap Maximum Angle**

#### Slivers
Copper slivers are areas in the copper that are so narrow they may flake off. This check detects potential slivers on the electrical and composite layers in the design.

Copper slivers (Figure 121\) should be eliminated whenever possible to prevent defect from occurring during the etching process.

<span id="page-35-1"></span>Minimum Copper indicates the maximum size of the copper slivers to flag. This flags slivers of a width less than this value. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

**Figure 121. Sliver**

Mask slivers in the solder mask layer are areas where the solder mask is so narrow they may flake off. These flakes float around and may drop into an area that needs to be soldered later, resulting in a bad board.

<span id="page-35-2"></span>Minimum Mask \(Figure 122) indicates the maximum size of the slivers to flag. This flags slivers of a width less than this value. This check runs top and bottom solder mask layers, if visible as defined by CAM documents.

**Figure 122. Minimum Mask Size**

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_35_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### Solder Bridges
When a mask layer is created, openings for pads may be oversized too much and expose an adjacent trace or other conductive object. Therefore, during fabrication, the copper for that pad may become too close and create a bridge to the adjacent object. Solder bridges are usually caused by problems during mask data creation.

The CAD system used may be unable to validate that what was created is going to work.

<span id="page-35-3"></span>The Minimum Gap \(Figure 123) is the maximum distance the solder can bridge and cause a connection to an adjacent object within the same mask opening. If the adjacent object is farther from the pad than this distance, even if the mask layer exposes it, it will not be identified as a bridge.

#### Starved Thermals
Many designs are plagued by thermal pad problems for negative CAM planes because the CAD system did not verify whether the thermals were going to make good connections to the copper plane.

The Starved Thermals fabrication check verifies whether each thermal connection to the negative CAM plane is valid, or if it has been constricted by adjacent data that is too close or overlapping – effectively starving out the ties. This check runs on all visible CAM negative plane layers as defined by CAM documents.

Starved Thermal Minimum Clearance is the percentage of the area next to the spoke of the thermal that must not be blocked by another object. Any smaller opening is considered starved.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_36_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 124. Starved Thermals**

Starved Thermal Minimum Spokes is the number of thermal spokes that cannot be blocked by another object. Any less will be considered starved. The number of spokes is specified as EVERY, meaning all spokes must not be blocked, or as an integer from 1 to 4.

#### Annular Ring
The Annular Ring area lets you set up annular ring checks by comparing data on different layers. This test checks both the size and the offset between the two layers.

The checks (described in the table below) assure that proper clearances are observed to alleviate manufacturing problems in the board fabrication processes. Layers to be tested are derived from CAM documents and pad stack data. This area provides selections for pad, mask, and drill checks. When drill sizes are analyzed for annular rings, the drill oversize setting on the Tools > Options > Design tab is not considered.

#### Silkscreen Over Pads
The Silkscreen Over Pads check lets you set up the clearance for comparing data on silkscreen layers against top and bottom electrical layers. This check analyzes both the size and the offset between the two layers.

Layers to be tested are derived from CAM documents and pad stack data. This check is run for top and bottom electrical layers against their associated silkscreen layers.

**Figure 125. Comparing Data on Silkscreen Layers**

#### Trace Width/Pad Size
The Trace Width/Pad Size check runs minimum trace width and minimum pad size checks for electrical layers.

The Trace Width check detects small electrical traces on the electrical layers in the design. Minimum Trace indicates the maximum size of the traces to flag. Traces with a width less than this value will be flagged. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

The Pad Size check detects small pads on the electrical layers in the design before the board is manufactured. Minimum Pad indicates the maximum size of the pads to flag. Pads with a diameter less than this value will be flagged. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

### Fabrication Check Types
Fabrication checks are used to verify that a design is manufacturable and that typical fabrication issues have been eliminated from the design.
