| Glued          | Glues the via so you cannot move it. If you try to move the via, a<br>message will appear notifying you that the via is glued. You can<br>override the glue setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                | You can fix a via's location on the fabrication board by turning on the<br>Glued check box in the Via Properties dialog box. The points of a bed<br>of nails test apparatus are matched to the test point locations, which<br>can be vias. So if you redesign and remanufacture the board, the<br>glued test points prevent the vias from moving in the new design, thus<br>preventing costly retooling of the test equipment.       |
| Test Point     | Makes the via or pin a test point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                | This is a three-state check box that depends on the state of the<br>selected objects. If all of the selected vias or pins are a test point, then<br>it is on. If none of the selected vias or pins are a test point, then it is off.<br>If some of the selected vias or pins are a test point and some are not,<br>then it is undefined.                                                                                             |
|                | You can make all selected vias or pins test points by turning Test Point<br>on and choosing Apply. You can remove the test point from all selected<br>vias or pins by turning Test Point off and choosing Apply. When you<br>click Apply the pad stack is automatically checked to see if the via or<br>pin can be a test point; for example, you cannot make buried vias test<br>points because a probe cannot access a buried via. |
|                | Tip<br>When the via or pin is flagged as a test point, and Show Test<br>Points is checked in the Options dialog box > Routing category ><br>General subcategoryon page 1542, an arrow is drawn on it in the<br>design:                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Plane Thermal  | Determines whether the pin or via is eligible to receive a thermalon<br>page 1866. The status of a thermal is set individually by pin and via,<br>and the thermal indicators will appear on plane layers only. Click to<br>clear this check box if you do not want the via or pin to connect to any<br>plane.                                                                                                                        |
|                | Once a pin or via is eligible, it is not automatically assigned a thermal<br>attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Modifying Via Properties

## Vias Dialog Box
To access: Type v > press the Enter key

Use the Vias dialog box to specify how SailWind Layout should determine the via type to use when you add a via or a virtual pin. When you choose a via type, SailWind Layout uses it with the Add Via, Add Via to Guide, and Add Virtual Pin commands.

**Tip** You can also change the via type during routing.

| Via Mode area | • Automatic — When you add a via or virtual pin, SailWind Layout<br>chooses from all via types, through or partial, that can handle<br>the particular layer change, if any. (Virtual pins, unlike vias, do<br>not necessarily change layers.) If SailWind Layout finds partial<br>via types dedicated to the layer change, it chooses from them. If<br>SailWind Layout cannot find a dedicated partial via type, it selects<br>any through via types for a through or partial layer change even<br>if the via type is not one that is specifically selected in the Via list.<br>It then checks the Routing Rules Dialog Boxfor via types that are<br>allowed for the net to which you are adding a via or virtual pin. If<br>more than one via type still passes, SailWind Layout installs the one<br>with the smallest drill diameter or smaller pad size. |
|               | Automatic allows only via types that begin and end on the Layer<br>Pair shown in the Options dialog box > Routing category > General<br>subcategoryon page 1542. To use automatic via mode, the layer<br>pair for routing and the layer pair for the partial via type need to<br>match. For example, if you have a partial via type set up for layers 1<br>through 4, and the layer pair for routing is set for layers 1 through 8,<br>automatic mode will not insert a via.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Color by Net area  | Sets a color to a selected net in the View Nets list. When you assign a<br>color to a net, pads, unroutes, and vias on all layers, as well as traces<br>optionally appear in that color, making it easier to identify nets when<br>splitting planes. When you split planes, you can assign colors to the<br>critical signals and then create correct copper planes with greater ease.<br>All net color assignments are saved with the design. |

|                  | Tip<br>The points of a bed of nails test apparatus are matched to the test<br>point locations, which can be virtual pins. So if you redesign and<br>remanufacture the board, glued test points prevent the virtual pins<br>from moving in the new design, thus preventing costly retooling of<br>the test equipment.

| Width           | Type a width for the wire bond. The valid range is from 0 through 250<br>mils. If you enter 0, the display line has a width of 0.01 mil.                                                            |
| Length          | Displays the length, in current design units, of the currently selected<br>wire bond.                                                                                                               |
| Angle           | Displays the angle, in degrees, of the currently selected wire bond.                                                                                                                                |
| Rules Data      | Displays the current wire bond rules information taken from the Wire<br>Bond Rules Dialog Box.                                                                                                      |
| CBP button      | Opens the CBP Properties Dialog Boxfor the component bond pad<br>connected to the currently selected substrate bond pad. This button is<br>unavailable if there is no connected component bond pad. |
| SBP button      | Opens the SBP Properties Dialog Boxfor the substrate bond pad<br>connected to the currently selected component bond pad. This button<br>is unavailable if there is no connected substrate bond pad. |
| WB Rules button | Opens the Wire Bond Rules Dialog Box.                                                                                                                                                               |
