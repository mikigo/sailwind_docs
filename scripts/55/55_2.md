Use this dialog box to export 3D model mappings from a PCB design to the Reuse folder location. Exporting 3D model mappings is optional; however, exporting them allows you to reuse the 3D model with the associated decal in future designs.

|             | SailWind Layout imports 3D models into the PCB design in the<br>default layout with which they were originally created (automatic<br>alignment). You can manually adjust the alignment of the 3D<br>model using the Align 3D Models Dialog Box. |
|             | Updating a decal in the Reuse folder location with a 3D model<br>that has been manually aligned results in a new default<br>alignment.                                                                                                          |

|                                | • Do not overwrite Library — Prevents overwriting of any<br>existing 3D model mappings. Decals mapped in the PCB<br>to 3D models that differ from those mappings in the Reuse<br>folder location remain in the PCB design only. |  |
|                                | • Overwrite all in Library — Overwrites any existing 3D model<br>mappings already in the Reuse folder location with those in<br>the PCB design.                                                                                 |  |

## Variant/Substitute Dialog Box
To access: **Tools > Assembly Variants** and then one of the following:

- Click an Assembly Variant in which you want to substitute the component from the Variant **Name**  list, select the component name to change, and click Substituted in the Status area.
- Select a component in the multicolumn list, and click Substitute in the Status area.
- Click Substitute from the Verb Mode list, and select a component in the Layout Editor.

The Variant/Substitute dialog box appears when you choose to substitute a component in an assembly variant. When you substitute a component, the substitution is referred to as the active component. The original component that you substituted is referred to as the default. The default component is what exists in the base option and the raw database.

## Verify Design Dialog Box
**To access: Tools > Verify Design**

You can check for individual or all design errors using the Verify Design dialog box. Check for the following types of errors: clearance, connectivity, high speed, number of vias, plane connection, test point, fabrication, wire bond. You cannot use this dialog box to check reference designator, part type, or attribute labels for clearance violations.
