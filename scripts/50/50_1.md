## HiSpeed Rules Dialog Box
To access: **Setup> Design Rules** menu item > choose a hierarchy level > **High Speed** button

Use this dialog box to set up high-speed rules.

**Note:** The Electrodynamic Checking (EDC) licensed option is required to check high-speed rules.

## HYP Export Dialog Box
To access: Choose the **File > Export** menu item and select "Hyp Files (\*.hyp)" from the "Save as type" dropdown list; then click **Save**

Use the HYP Export dialog box to export the design in the form of a HYP file.

**Description**

For information about the format of the HYP file and creating a "BoardSim-friendly" design, see the PADS HyperLynx online Help. SailWind Layout passes the Value, Tolerance, Voltage, PADS HyperLynx, and PowerGround attributes to the HYP file. BoardSim uses these attributes to obtain values for resistors and capacitors, and to transfer information about fixed voltage nets.

**Note:**

Only PADS HyperLynx v8.0 or newer can open the file that is exported by this dialog box. The *.hyp* file that is created is a v2.34 format file.

Exporting to PADS HyperLynx BoardSim

## IDF Export Dialog Box
To access: **File> Export** menu item > Select IDF File > **Save**

Use the IDF Export dialog box to exchange design data between SailWind Layout and a mechanical design system. You can export IDF files to export board outlines, keepouts, components, and holes to a mechanical design system.

**Tip** Set any IDF-specific part heighton page 303 information, drilled holeon page 302 information, or part outlineon page 302 information for a more accurate IDF export.
