### Adjusting Snap While Dimensioning
You can adjust snap mode while selecting dimensioning points. This capability can be important when dimensioning angles.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and on the Dimensioning Toolbar, click a dimensioning style button.
- 2. If needed, right-click and click a snap mode popup menu item.

The following table lists the snap modes and their descriptions.

| Snap to:     | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Corner       | Snaps to the endpoints of a line segment or arc. A corner is where a design<br>object changes direction.                                                                      |
| Midpoint     | Snaps to the center point of a line segment or arc. Circles are selected at the<br>180-degree point, left side, since arcs are drawn with the starting point on<br>the right. |
| Any Point    | Snaps to the closest point on a line segment, arc, or circle.                                                                                                                 |
| Center       | Snaps to the center of the closest circle, arc, or pad.                                                                                                                       |
| Circle/Arc   | Snaps to the radius point of an arc or circle.                                                                                                                                |
| Intersection | Snaps to closest point where two or more objects intersect.                                                                                                                   |
| Quadrant     | Snaps to the closest orthogonal point, 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, on an arc<br>or circle. Arcs must pass through an orthogonal point to be selected.                         |
| Do Not Snap  | Snaps to any grid point.                                                                                                                                                      |

**Table 132. Snap Modes**

**Restriction:**

Snap mode is unavailable for Auto and Arc type dimensioning styles. These styles support the auto-snap mode only because they apply to selected line segments and arcs, not selected points.

- 3. Select the first dimensioning point.
- 4. If needed, right-click and click another snap mode and then select the second dimensioning point.
- 5. If you selected the Angular dimensioning style, repeat steps 4-5 as needed to select the other side of the angle.

## Selecting the Parent Dimensioning Object
You can select the parent dimension object from a selected dimension element.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one of the items in the dimension object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Parent** popup menu item. The entire dimension is selected.

## Moving Dimensions and Dimension Objects
You can move Dimensions or Dimension Objects using the Move command or by dynamically dragging objects.

Moving an Entire Dimension Moving a Dimension Object Moving Text to Its Default Location Dynamically Drag Objects Changing Lengths

### Moving an Entire Dimension
When required, you can move an entire dimension. This is useful when you need to create additional space for another dimension or callout.

**Procedure**

1. Select the dimension object through multiple selection, or by using the Select Parenton page 926 button in the Properties dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/40/_page_12_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Note:** To move dimension objects using keyboard entered coordinates, use the Dimension Object Properties dialog boxon page 1311.

- 2. Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item and the dimension object dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 3. Click to indicate a location for the object.

The dimension object remains selected for additional moving, if required.

### Moving a Dimension Object
You can move individual dimension objects, including: arrows (with their lines), text strings, extension lines, and leader segments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a dimension object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
- 3. Click to indicate the new location for the dimension object.

The new position of the text and the location of the arrows are determined by the current settings in the Options dialog box > **Dimensioning** categories.

**Tip** If you select and move an extension line, the dimension line and the dimension text are both automatically modified to reflect the new measurement. Stretching the extension line without changing the measurement is performed with the Change Lengthon page 927 command. This command works in the same manner as moving arrows, but works with selected extension lines.

### Moving Text to Its Default Location
If you have repositioned a text object, you can move the text to its default location.

**Procedure**

1. Click the dimensioning text to select it.

If you cannot select the text, check the selection filter settings.

2. Right-click and click the **Default Location** popup menu item.

![](/layout/guide/40/_page_13_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** To add a new segment to an existing leader, right-click and click the **Add Corner** and **Split**  popup menu items.

### Dynamically Drag Objects
Objects can be dynamically dragged to reposition them. This allows you to quickly and intuitively reposition objects.

**Prerequisites**

You must set the "Drag moves" setting to "Drag and drop" in **Tools > Options** menu item, **Global**  category > **General** subcatory.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an object.
- 2. Place the pointer over the selected object, then click and hold the left mouse button to initiate Drag mode.
- 3. Move the mouse to the new location for the object and release the left mouse button.

### Changing Lengths
With an extension line selected, the Change Length command adjusts the position of the dimension line and arrows without changing the actual measurement. When used, the dimension object is attached to, and moves along with, the pointer, such as when a new dimension is created.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the extension line for which you want to change the length.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Change Length** popup menu item and the dimension object dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 3. Click to indicate the new location for the dimension.
