### Attribute Types
You can assign many types of attributes to the objects in your designs, including the free-text type, the yes/no type, and the list type.

The Free Text Attribute Type The Yes/No Attribute Type The List Attribute Type The Measure Attribute Type Creating a Number or Decimal Number Type Attribute

#### The Free Text Attribute Type
You can select the Free Text attribute type to use any text as the attribute value. This is the default. Free text is not "intelligent," meaning you can type the name of the net as an attribute, but renaming the net does not update the attribute.

With the Free Text type you can select the Case-sensitive parameter to preserve the letter case of Free Text entries. This setting affects sorting and matching in the Find Dialog Boxand the Attribute Manager Dialog Box.

#### The Yes/No Attribute Type
You can select the Yes/No attribute type to create a list where you can select "Yes" or "No" as the attribute value.

#### The List Attribute Type
The List attribute type allows you to create a list from which to choose the value.

Creating a List Type Attribute Deletion of List Entries

##### Creating a List Type Attribute
You can create a list of entries as options for the attribute value. For example, you can create a list of all of your part manufacturers that is used every time you assign the attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box, click **New**.
- 3. In the Attribute Properties dialog boxon page 1115, type the name of the new attribute to create in the Attribute text box.

## Modifying Design Attribute Properties
Use the Attribute Dictionary to modify design attribute properties.

**Prerequisites**

If an attribute is ECO-Registered, you must be in ECO mode to modify the attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box, click the attribute to modify from the list. Default attributes and the design attributes are listed. You can select an attribute groupon page 1811 from the Group list to filter the view and display only a select group of attributes. Attributes are grouped if they are structured attributeson page 1862.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** If you select the Show Hidden check box, you can view attribute groups that have no visible attributes. You set whether an attribute is hidden on the **Objects** tab of the Attribute Properties dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_6.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

You can modify the default attributes; however, it is not recommended.

**3. Click Properties.**

4. In the Attribute Properties dialog box,on page 1115 click the **Types** tab, and click the type for the attribute.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_11.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

If you use the design unit Mil, assign the attribute at the board level, otherwise the unit will not change when you change units for the design (using the Options dialog box > **Global**  category > General subcategoryon page 1531).

- 5. Click the Objects tabon page 1111, and click the objects you want to restrict. You cannot assign the attribute to a restricted object. For example, if you are defining the properties for a Manufacturer attribute, you may want to restrict nets so they cannot have this attribute. Therefore, you would disable the Net object for the Manufacturer attribute.
- 6. To use the default hierarchy, click the Use Default Hierarchy check box. If you choose not to use the default hierarchy, you can modify it. Modifying the hierarchy is considered an advanced procedure.
- 7. If you want to enable ECO Registrationon page 1824 of the attribute, click the ECO Registered check box. If you enable ECO Registration, changes made to the attributes are recorded in the ECO file. Enabling ECO Registration also restricts you to modifying attributes while the ECO Toolbar is active (ECO mode).
- 8. Click **OK** when you finish setting attribute properties to return to the Attribute Dictionary dialog box.
- 9. Click **Close**.

## Deleting Design Attributes
Use the Attribute Dictionary to delete attributes in your design. If you delete a decal attribute, any labels associated with it now associate with non-decal attributes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary dialog box, on page 1107click the attribute to delete from the list. You can select an attribute groupon page 1811 from the Group list to filter the view and display only a select group of attributes. Attributes are grouped if they are structured attributeson page 1862. Clear the Show Hidden check box to filter the list to show only attribute groups that contain at least one visible attribute.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_36_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

You can delete the default attributes; however, it is not recommended. Because the default attributes are only provided for your design and not assigned to objects, you do not need to delete these attributes.

- 3. Click **Delete**. If you select a hidden attribute, this button is unavailable. The message "Are you sure you want to delete attribute type XXX?" appears.
- 4. Click **Yes** to delete the attribute.

## Attribute Manager
Use the Attribute Manager to view a spreadsheet of all of the attributes on all objects in the design.

You can use the Attribute Manager to add, edit, and delete attribute values on multiple object types. You can also create value summaries of an attribute that is based on every value of the attribute assigned to objects of the same type. In other words, summaries are applied per attribute and apply to all objects on the same tab.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Hidden attributes are not available to the Attribute Manager and are not listed in the Show Attributes dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Note:**

Rows in the multi-column list are unavailable if the attribute is read-onlyon page 1853. Rows are also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824 and SailWind Layout is not in ECO modeon page 1824. Hidden attributes do not appear in the list. All objects appear in the multi-column list, regardless of whether they have attributes assigned to them. Objects that do not have attributes assigned to them have <none> in the cell under the attribute name. Objects that have attributes assigned to them, but not values, have blank cells under the attribute name.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** You can avoid DRC violations or shorts by placing attributes on Documentation layers if used in the design. If an attribute is displayed in the design, and placed on an Electrical layer it will show up as copper in the manufacturing documents. Place free text and attribute values on the Silkscreen Top layer or another documentation layer.

### Listing Design Objects
The multi-column list of the Attribute Manager catalogs design objects and the attributes assigned to them. Objects appear in the left column and their attribute names appear in the column headers.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box in the View area, click a view option:
- **Selected**  Lists attributes from the objects selected in the design. If you select objects in the design and then open the Attribute Manager, selected objects appear on their appropriate tab. If you do not select objects of a certain type, the tab is unavailable. To view other objects, use the Filter.
- **Filter**  Lists attributes from all of the objects in your design. This view option allows you to view attributes assigned to non-selectable objects, such as Decals and Part Types. When using the filter, type the first characters of the objects to view, type an asterisk (\*) after the character, and then click **Apply Filter**. The objects appear on the appropriate tab in the multi-column list.

### Selecting Attributes to List in the Attribute Manager
Use the Show Attributes dialog box to select attributes to list in the multi-column list of the Attribute Manager.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, click **Show**.
- 3. In the "Show Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1720, select an attribute group in the Group list or <all> for all attributes. Use the Group list to filter the Attributes list. You can choose an attribute groupon page 1811 to view.

**Tip** You can use the **Select All** or **Unselect All** buttons to select all or clear all check boxes.

### Adding Attribute Values to Design Objects With the Attribute Manager
In the Attribute Manager, you can add an attribute and value to one or more objects that do not already have the attribute assigned to it. You can add values to cells with "<none>" in it, which means the attribute is available to the design but you have not already assigned it to an object.

You can add attribute values to a design object only for attributes that are available to the design. To create a new attribute for use with design objects, see "Creating Attributes for the Design". You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see "Default Units".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a hidden attribute, read-only attributeon page 1853, or ECO-registered attributeon page 1824 while not in ECO modeon page 1824.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, select a cell with <none> in it.
- 3. Click **Add**.
- 4. Type a value in the cell and press the Enter key.

**Tip** You can only add attribute values to a design object for attributes that are available to the design. To create a new attribute for use with design objects, see "Creating Attributes for  the Design". You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see "Default Units".

### Modifying Attribute Values Using the Attribute Manager
In the Attribute Manager, you can edit blank attribute value cells or cells with a value. If a cell is blank, it means that the assigned attribute has no value.
