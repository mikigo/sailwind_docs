### Modifying the Default Attribute Dictionary
You can edit the default attribute dictionary. You may want to change the default dictionary so it matches your library attributes.

The list of default attributes is stored in two ASCII files, both stored in the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version> \Settings* folder.

- **Default.asc**  Used for new designs.
- **DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc** Used for older (pre-version 3.0) designs. If this file is not found, an attribute dictionary is not loaded with older designs.

The appropriate ASCII file automatically imports when you create a new file or import an older file. For more information, see "File Open Conversions" and "Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box".

**Prerequisites**

Back up your Default.asc or DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc before you overwrite it.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> New** menu item.
- 2. If you want to edit the default attributes to use with older files, click the **File> Import** menu item and import the file *DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc*.
- 3. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 4. Modify the existing attributes or add attributes as needed. For more information, see "Modifying  Design Attribute Properties".
- 5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
- 6. To overwrite the existing file, click the **File> Export** menu item. Do this to change the *default.asc*  or the *DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc* files. If you want to create a new start-up file to use with only new files, go to Step 10.
- 7. Click **ASCII** as the file type and click **Save**. The ASCII Output dialog box appears.
- 8. In the Sections list, select the Attributes check box.
- 9. Click **OK**. The default attribute dictionary is replaced.
- 10. To create a new start-up file, follow the steps described in Creating Start-up Files. Make sure you select the Attributes check box in the Start-up File Output dialog box. A new start-up file is created. You can use this start-up file with all new designs.

### Assignment of Attributes
If you cannot select the object to which you want to assign an attribute, select the related object.

The following table defines the relationship of the objects. For more information, see "Applying an Attribute Value to All Other Objects" on page 395 for assigning to the same object types and Attribute  Manageron page 392 topics to assign to multiple object types.

| Object    | What to Select     |
|-----------|--------------------|
| PCB       | Any object         |
| Part Type | A design component |

**Table 82. Assignment of Attributes**

| Object    | What to Select                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Decal     | A design component                  |
| Part      | A design component                  |
| Jumper    | A Jumper                            |
| Pin       | A Pin                               |
| Net Class | A net that is a member of the class |
| Net       | A Net                               |
| Via       | A Via                               |

**Table 82. Assignment of Attributes(continued)**

### Attribute Values
Attribute values can be 2047 characters long. You can use any printable character, including spaces, in an attribute value. You cannot, however, use a space as the first or last character in the value.

When you enter an attribute value, the exact value you type (in dialog boxes, ASCII files, or the library) is stored. This means that capitalization, leading and trailing zeros, embedded spaces, specific unit prefixes, and the presentation of the Yes/No value are all stored exactly as you type them. Leading and trailing spaces are not saved. Invalid values are not saved.

Exact values are saved for the following attribute types:

- Number
- Decimal umber
- Yes/No
- Measure

Exact values are not saved in the Attribute Dictionary entry for the List attribute type or when you set Limits for Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types. For the Number attribute type, leading zeros are removed. For Decimal Number and Measure attribute types, leading zeros are removed, trailing zeros after the decimal point are removed, and numbers greater than 14 characters are rounded. Numbers with more than 14 zeros may be converted to scientific notation.

When using attribute values:

- Automation does not pass the exact attribute value for Yes/No, Number, or Decimal Number attribute types. Automation does, however, pass the exact attribute value for the Measure attribute type.
- Automation ignores whether an attribute is read only, system, or hidden. Therefore, Automation can change all attributes (properties, Attribute Dictionary entry, and value), regardless of their state.

#### Special Attribute Measurements
You can enter complex units like ounces/sq. foot for copper thickness; however, SailWind Layout does not input, process, or output prefixes for complex units.

• Size/Dimension. SailWind Layout accepts as input, processes, and outputs Size/Dimension units using the values shown in the table below.

| Unit set on Global Tab<br>(Options) | Output Example | Comment             |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Mils                                | 12 mil         | 1 mil = 25.4*10-6 m |
| Metric                              | 3 mm           | 1 mm = 1*10-3 m     |
| Inches                              | 2"             | 1" = 25.4*10-3 m    |

**Table 83. Size and Dimension Measurements**

• Percentages. SailWind Layout accepts as input, processes, and outputs a percentage, like 10%, if you use the percent symbol (%).

#### Number/Decimal Number Attribute Values and ECO
SailWind Layout automatically converts attribute values for the Number, Decimal Number, or Measure type properties during the ECO process.

For example, a frequency value, if entered as 100 at the schematic or library, is converted to .1 kHz by default. Also, leading and trailing zeroes are truncated. For example, the decimal number 123.400 becomes 123.4.

Although these conversions are correct, Compare Netlist and the ECO process, detect and report these conversions as differences. Therefore, a design populated with attributes could have thousands of warnings. To avoid this, do one of the following:

- Define attributes as Free Text type in the Attribute Dictionary. When you want to take advantage of the math functions in the Attribute Manager dialog box, go to the Attribute Dictionary and change the type to Number, Decimal Number, or Measure. Then, before performing a comparison or beginning an ECO, set the type back to Free Text.
- Use the Number, Decimal Number, or Measure types. Make sure the attributes are ECOregistered and then perform a backward annotation. The values are converted in the design and backward annotated to the schematic. The schematic and PCB layout will now be synchronized.

#### Exact Attribute Value Examples
The exact value required for an attribute varies depending on the type of attribute, such as number, decimal, or measurement.

The following tables provide some specific examples of exact attribute values.

#### List Exception
Although SailWind Layout does not save exact List type values, it does change list entries to match the Attribute Dictionary entry.

For example, if the Attribute Dictionary entry for a list type attribute has Intel, IBM, and AMD as list choices, and you enter intel as a value, SailWind Layout changes the entry to Intel. The lowercase i is changed to uppercase. The following table lists exceptions for voltage measures.

**Table 88. Measure, Voltage Attribute Exceptions**

#### Measure, Geometry.Height (Size/Dimension) Attribute Exceptions
If you do not specify a unit of measure for a Size/Dimension Measure type attribute, SailWind Layout does not save the exact value.

The value is not saved because a number in the attribute value without a unit creates confusion if you change the current units.

| V 4.0 and higher Input |               | V 4.0 and higher Output for Current Units |         |             |  |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|--|
| String                 | Current Units | Mils                                      | Inches  | Metric (mm) |  |
| 10                     | mils          | 10mil                                     | 0.01"   | 0.254mm     |  |

| 10                     | metric        | 39.37mil                                  | 0.3937" | 10mm        |  |

**Table 89. Measure, Geometry Height Attribute Exceptions**

**Tip** Using a non-standard format for your value might cause SailWind Layout to change the value even if you do not change the current units. For example entering a value of 0001.2000mil, causes SailWind Layout to change the value to 1.2mil.

#### Default Units
You can include a unit with an attribute value. SailWind Layout provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) acceptable for input and for output.

SailWind Layout uses Systeme Internationale units, or SI units. Units are exported with attributes and are converted appropriately. User-defined units (dollar, yen, feet, pound, ounces/sq. foot, and so on) are not converted. Also, you cannot use prefixes with user-defined units.

The following units are supported, but are either enabled or disabled for actual use within SailWind Layout. To change the units that appear in this list, see Customizing Units for Attributes.

**Tip**

An extra comma (,) means that you can enter the abbreviation for the unit without a prefix. For example, you can enter O for Ohm in an attribute value; it is a valid value. You cannot, however, add F for Farad in an attribute value; it is not a valid value. You must use Farad with a prefix.

**Supported Units**

The following table lists units that are supported in SailWind Layout.

| Abbreviation | Unit   | Enabled | Allowed Prefixes | Quantity         |

#### Customizing Units for Attributes
In addition to the standard attributes, you can add and modify custom attributes to a design to meet your own specialized requirements.

**Procedure**

- 1. Navigate to the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Programs* folder.
- 2. Open the *SailWindpcb.ini* file in a text editor, such as Notepad.
- 3. Add a new attribute unit section by typing the header [SI Units].
- 4. Make modifications as required:
	- a. To Enable Units:
		- i. To enable units, delete the "ignore;" variable from the line. For example, the line for the Gram unit reads:

```
Gram=ignore;u,m,,k
```
ii. Modify the line so it reads:

Gram=u,m,,k

- b. To Disable Units:
	- i. To disable units, add the "ignore;" variable to the line. For example, the line for the Farad unit reads:

Farad=p,n,u,m

ii. Modify the line so it reads:

Farad=ignore;p,n,u,m

- iii. It is recommended that you leave the unit prefixes intact even when disabling the unit. This makes it easier to enable the unit later because you will not have to specify prefixes again.
- 5. Save the *SailWindpcb.ini* file.
