### Deleting Attribute Values
In the Attribute Manager, you can delete an attribute and value from a design object.

**CAUTION:**

You cannot delete a read-only attributeon page 1853, or an ECO-registered attributeon page 1824 while not in ECO modeon page 1824.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, select a cell with a value.
- 3. Click **Delete**. The message "Are you sure you want to delete attribute value <attribute name>: <attribute value>?" appears.
- 4. Click **Yes** to delete the value.

The attribute and value are removed from the object and the cell value is <none>.

### Applying an Attribute Value to All Other Objects
In the Attribute Manager, you can apply an attribute value from one object to all other objects of the same type. In other words, you can set the same attribute value for all objects of the same type. Any existing values remain unchanged.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, click the cell whose attribute value you want to apply to the other objects on the tab.
- 3. Click **Fill Column**. The "Are you sure you want to fill <name of attribute> for all objects by <selected value>?" message appears.
- 4. Click **Yes** to apply the value. The attribute and its value are applied to the other cells in that column, except for Summary cells.

### Creating a Summary
Create and modify attribute summaries that are based on every value of the attribute assigned to objects of the same type. In other words, summaries apply per attribute and are summed up from all objects in the same tab of the multi-column list. You can also change the summary type. The summaries appear at the bottom of attribute columns.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Summaries are only available for Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types. The type is an attribute property. For more information, see "Attribute Types".
- Hidden attributes are not available to the Attribute Manager and are not listed in the Show Attributes dialog box.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, click **Show**.

**Note:** An attribute must be selected for viewing in the Attribute Manager. See "Selecting Attributes to List in the Attribute Manager" for more information.

- 3. In the "Show Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1720 select an attribute in the Attributes list.
- 4. Select the check boxes for the summary types you want to create for each attribute type.
- 5. Click **OK** to return to the Attribute Manager dialog box. The summary you created appears in the last two rows of the multi-column list. If you enabled more than one summary, the second summary appears in the two rows following the first summary.
- 6. You can create summaries or edit the summary types for other attribute columns without going into the Show Attributes dialog box. In another qualified attribute column (Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types), double-click in the cell of the first summary row (used for the title of the summary type).
- 7. Choose a summary from the list, and press the Enter key. The new summary information appears.

## Design Object Attributes
Use the resizable Object Attributes dialog box to add, modify, or remove attributes of single objects or multiple objects of the same type.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_42_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Rows in the multicolumn list are unavailable if the attribute is read-onlyon page 1853. Rows are also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824 and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.

**Note:**

You can avoid DRC violations or shorts by placing attributes on Documentation layers if used in the design. If an attribute is displayed in the design, and placed on an Electrical layer it will show up as copper in the manufacturing documents. Place free text and attribute values on the Silkscreen Top layer or another documentation layer.

### Assigning Attributes to Design Objects With the Object Attributes Dialog
You can assign attributes to an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box.

For example, you can select multiple parts and assign attributes, but you cannot select parts and vias and assign attributes. The Object Attribute dialog box only shows attributes that apply to the objects you select.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object(s) to which you want to assign an attribute. You can only select objects of the same type.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item. The "Object Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1496 opens. For more information, see "Assigning Attributes to Design Objects With the  Object Attributes Dialog".
- 3. From the Groups list click an attribute groupon page 1811 to view. If you assign multiple attributes and some of those are structured attributeson page 1862, this list acts as a filter and allows you to choose the attribute group to view.
- 4. From the Attributes For list, select the attribute hierarchy level for which you want to assign an attribute. The hierarchy levels change, depending on the object you selected in step 1. For more information, see "Attribute Hierarchy".

**Note:**

You cannot select a hierarchy level if you have multiple objects selected. The attribute is assigned at the current level; for example, if you select multiple parts, attributes are assigned at the Component level.

- 5. Click **Add**. A new, blank attribute line appears in the Attribute list. The pointer appears in the blank cell in the Attribute column. This cell is also a list that contains the attributes that apply to the object type you selected in step 1. This list is based on entries in the Attribute Dictionary. For more information, see "Attribute Dictionary".
- 6. Click an attribute from the Attribute list, or type the name of a new attribute in the blank cell. You cannot add a hidden or read-onlyon page 1853 attribute. Lists the name of the attribute. Attributes names can be 255 characters long. You can use any printable character, including spaces, in an attribute name. A space, however, cannot be the first or last character in the attribute name. Attribute names are not case sensitive, and they are defined for the entire design, not per object.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_43_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** When you add a new attribute to the design, it is also added to the Attribute Dictionary.

7. Double-click in the blank cell in the Value column (next to the attribute you just added). Assign the value for the attribute. You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. The Level column lists the hierarchy level where the attribute is assigned. In other words, the attribute is inherited from the level that appears in this column. It takes its value from the Attributes For list. For more information, see "Default Units".

**Tip** If you use the design unit Mil, assign the attribute at the board level. Otherwise the unit will not change when you change units for the design (using the **Global** tab of the Options dialog box).

8. Click **Close** to close the Object Attributes dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_43_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** You can add the same attribute multiple times, as long as you add it to different levels of the attribute hierarchy.

### Modifying Attribute Values
You can modify the attribute values of an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box. When you select multiple objects to modify attributes, the Attributes list displays the union of all attribute names.

In other words, the Attributes list displays the attributes that belong to all of the selected objects. When you add an attribute, you add it to all selected objects, and when you delete a value, you delete it from all objects with that attribute. You can edit the value of a selected attribute if the current level defines the attribute.

For example, if the text in the "Level" column matches the text in the "Attribute For" list, you can edit the value. If the current level does not define the attribute (the text in the Level column does not match the text in the Attributes For list), SailWind Layout adds a new attribute for the current level that matches the attribute you want to edit. You can then edit the value in the new attribute. You cannot edit the name of an attribute. You can either delete the attribute entirely, using the Attribute Dictionaryon page 355, or add a new attribute with the correct attribute name.

**Procedure**

1. If the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824, enter ECO mode. To enter ECO mode, click the ECO Toolbar button. If you do not enter ECO mode first, a message appears, informing you that you need to enter ECO mode.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_44_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot modify read-only attributeson page 1853.

For more information, see "ECO Options Dialog Box".

- 2. Select the object(s) to modify.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item. Attribute information about the selected object(s) appears in spreadsheet form in the "Object Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1496.
- 4. From the Groups list click an attribute groupon page 1811 to view. If you assign multiple attributes and some of those are structured attributeson page 1862, this list acts as a filter and allows you to choose the attribute group to view.
- 5. From the Attributes For list, click the attribute hierarchy level for which you want to assign an attribute. The hierarchy levels change, depending on the object you selected in step 1. For more information, see "Attribute Hierarchy".

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_44_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Note:**

You cannot click a hierarchy level if you have multiple objects selected. The attribute is assigned at the current level; for example, if you select multiple parts, attributes are assigned at the Component level.

- 6. Click the cell (in the Value column) of the attribute value to modify. If a cell is blank, it means that the attribute is assigned to the object, but has no value. It can also mean that the values differ for the selected objects.
- 7. Click **Edit**.
- 8. Type or click the new attribute value and press the Enter key. The new value is added to the objects. For more information, see "Attribute Values".

You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see "Default Units".

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_45_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** If attribute values are not the same, the value for that attribute is blank. If you modify that value, the new value applies to all objects with that attribute. You can also remove values from attributes (assign the attribute with no value).

### Removing Attributes
You can remove an attribute of an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box. You can only delete attributes on the current level. If you delete an attribute and a value appears for the attribute at a higher level in the hierarchy, it applies to the current level.

To delete the attribute entirely from the design, use the Attribute Dictionaryon page 355.

**Procedure**

1. If the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824, enter ECO mode. To enter ECO mode, click the **ECO Toolbar** button. The ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. If you do not enter ECO mode first, a message appears, informing you that you must enter ECO mode.
