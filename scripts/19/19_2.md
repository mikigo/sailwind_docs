### Default Design Rules
When it comes to creating default design rules, you can create default rules and apply them to all layers of a design or you can create default design rules and apply them to specific layers.

Creating Default Rules Creating Default Clearance-Rules for a Specific Layer

#### Creating Default Rules
Each new design already has a default set of rules or constraints. The default set either comes from the SailWind Layout *default.asc* template file or imports from the schematic design.

Customize the default rules to the requirements of your design. You can also create default clearance rules for a specific layeron page 416.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Design Rules** menu item.
- 2. In the Rules Dialog Box, click **Default**.

#### Creating Class Design Rules
A *class* is a collection of nets to which you can assign a common set of design rules. You must first create a class and assign nets to the class before you can assign rules to the class.

You create the class either by selecting nets in the design, or by selecting them from a list in the Class Rules dialog box, but you can only use the Class Rules dialog box to define its design rules.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create a new class using one of the following two methods:
	- Select nets in the design:
		- i. In the design area, select the nets you want to add to the class.

**Tip**

You can also use the Find dialog box to find nets and use wildcards in the Value field to filter the selection.

- ii. Right-click and click the **Make Class** popup menu item.
- iii. In the Add Net to Classon page 1058 dialog box, click Create New Class, type the class name in the Add to Class box, and then click **OK**.
- Select nets from the list in the Class Ruleson page 1162 dialog box:
	- i. Click the **Setup> Design Rules** menu item, and then click **Class**.
	- ii. In the Class name box, type the class name, and then click **Add**. The maximum class name length is 15 characters. You can use any alphanumeric characters except brackets {}, asterisks \*, or spaces.
- iii. In the Nets area, in the Available list, double-click to quickly add the net to the class, or select multiple nets and click **Add>>**. Nets cannot exist in more than one class. The Available list in the Class Rules dialog box displays only nets that have not been assigned to a class.
- 2. In the Class Rules Dialog Box(**Setup> Design Rules** menu item then **Class**), select the class in the Class box.
- 3. Click any of the three rule categoryon page 407 buttons (Clearance, Routing, HiSpeed) to customize the rules from their default values and settings.
- 4. After you have customized the rule categories, click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Class Rules dialog box.

**Results**

After you customize a rule category for the class, Non-Default Rules Indicatorsappear in the dialog box.
