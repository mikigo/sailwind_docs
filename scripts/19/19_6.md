## Restricting Heights in Areas of Component Layers
You can create a board height restriction to limit the height of components placed in an area of the board.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A board height restriction does not prevent placement of a decal that has no geometry.height attribute.
- No warning is given if you put a keepout over an already-placed component that is taller than the height restriction. The violation will be caught, however, when you run a clearance check in Verify Design.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Layer list of the Standard Toolbar, select a component layer.
- 2. Create a keepouton page 465 in the area of the board where you want to restrict component height.
- 3. In the Add Drafting dialog box, in the Restrictions area, select the Placement and the Component height check boxes.
- 4. Type the height restriction in the box.
- 5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

You will be unable to place components whose geometry.height attribute value is greater than the specified height restriction.

## Keepouts
*Keepouts* prevent the placement of design items within a specified area. Keepouts appear as one pixelwidth lines during interactive placement, cluster placement, routing, and other operations. The outer edge of design objects and board outlines/cutouts appear for use in clearance calculations against keepouts. Both the Online Design Rule Checking and Verify Design tools recognize keepouts as obstacles.

You can create keepouts in both the Layout Editor and the PCB Decal Editor. User interaction is the same for either; the only difference is the type of objects you can restrict.

**CAUTION:**

The three component type keepouts can only be created in the Layout Editor.

Creating Keepout Areas Modifying a Keepout

### Creating Keepout Areas
Create a keepout to define areas where design objects cannot be placed. You can create keepout areas using closed polygons (with or without arcs), circles, or rectangles. The current angle mode and design grid settings determine the placement of the lines.

**Note:**

When defining keepouts in the PCB Decal Editor, you can also assign keepouts to an <Opposite Side>. You cannot do this in the Layout Editor. Placement, Component Height, and Component Drill check boxes are unavailable in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, then click the **Keepout** button.
- 2. Right-click and click a draw mode for the type of shape to create.
- 3. Create a closed shape to define the keepout area.
- 4. In the Add Drafting dialog box on page 1054that appears, select restrictions.
- 5. Click the layer on which to place the keepout.

**Tip** When you choose layer assignments, restrictions not available for that layer are unavailable. For example, if you choose a non-placement layer, the Placement check box will not be available.

6. Click **OK**. The keepout is created. If you create other keepouts, they use the restrictions you set here as the default.

**Results**

The keepout is displayed with a widely spaced hatch filling the area. If the fill you are using for Copper or Copper Planes is similar and you find it difficult to distinguish them, you can change the direction of the keepouts to be the reverse in the "Hatch and Flood"on page 1511 options.

### Modifying a Keepout
You can change the size of a keepout just as you would any other drafting object: move an edge or corner, or change the diameter of a circle. You can also copy a keepout to another location and change its restrictions or layer assignments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the edge of a keepout, right-click and click the **Select Shape** popup menu item.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Drafting Properties dialog box, turn restrictions on or off and modify the layer settings. For more information, see "Drafting Object Properties."
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Tip** You cannot modify a keepout that is part of a physical design reuse. If you try to, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.
