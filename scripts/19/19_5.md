#### Creating a Pin Pair Against Pin Pair Design Rule for a Specific Layer
You can create clearance rules that apply between the same pin pair or two different pin pairs on a specific layer. These rules take precedence over pin pair against pin pair clearance rules that apply to all layers.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Design Rules** menu item and then click the **Conditional Rules** button.
- 2. In the Conditional Rule Setupon page 1199 dialog box, in the Source rule object area, choose the Pin Pairs option and then select a pin pair in the list. You can also filter the list of pin pairs to a single net by selecting the net in the From net list.
- 3. In the Current rule set area, choose the Clearance option.
- 4. In the Against rule object area, choose the Pin Pairs option and then select a pin pair from the list. You can also filter the list of pin pairs to a single net by selecting the net in the From net list.
- 5. In the Apply to layer list, select a specific layer.
- 6. Click **Create**.
- 7. In the Existing rule sets list, if not already selected, select the newly created rule set.
- 8. Set the required Clearance values.
- 9. When finished, close any open Rules dialog boxes.

#### Creating Differential Pair Design Rules
You can define differential pair rules for nets, pin pairs, or electrical nets that behave electrically as differential pairs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_57_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:** Nets, pin pairs, and electrical nets cannot exist in more than one differential pair. The Available list displays only items that have not been assigned to a differential pair.

- 4. Click **Add**.
- 5. Set the Properties of the pair.
- 6. Click **OK**.
- 7. Close the Rules dialog box.

- 4. Click **OK**.
- 5. Close the Rules dialog box.

## Creating a Report of the Design Rules
Use the Rules Report dialog box to create a report of some or all design rules. You can then print the report of the design rules.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Design Rules** menu item and then click the **Report** button.
- 2. In the Rules Report dialog box,on page 1677 in the Rule Types area, enable any of the rule types.

	- Select the check box to report all objects.
	- Select one or more items in the list to report only specific objects.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_58_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** In the Pin pairs area, you can filter the contents of the Pin pair list by selecting a net in the Net list.

- 4. If you want to report the default rules for each enabled rule type in the Rules Types area, select the Default Rules check box.
- 5. In the Output area, click one of the following options:
	- **Rule Sets**  Report all rules that are different from the default rules
	- **Rule Values** Report the values of all rules, even if they match the default rules values
- 6. Click **OK**.

**Results**

<span id="page-58-1"></span>The report is written to *C:\SailWind Projects\rules.rep* and displayed by the default text editor.

## Turning on Design Rule Checking
With *Online DRC*, you can enable live design rule checking as you work on your design. Online DRC prevents or reports design rule violations during interactive placement or routing.

Use Online DRC to constrain actions and avoid making design errors. You can run the Verify Design on page 1775 tool to search for and locate errors at any time.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- There are many design rules that are not checked by Online DRC. Some are only checked by SailWind Router (for example, Maximum number of vias) and others can only be checked as a post process by the Verify Design tool (for example, net Capacitance). Check the documentation and test the rule to ensure it works with Online DRC.
- Online DRC does not prevent you from moving objects in a flooded area. If you don't re-flood the area, Verify Design reports errors. If objects within a flooded area were moved, or thermal settings were changed since the original flooding, you need to flood the area again.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > Design categoryon page 1503.
- 2. In the Online DRC area, select a setting.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also initiate design rule checking using one of the Design Rule Checking modeless commands (drp, drw, dri, or dro). on page 1479

## Check Design Rules
You can perform a design rules check during interactive place and route operations, or after place and route operations are complete.

For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking".

Use Verify Design to check for design rule violations after placement or routing, and report any violations in the work area and in a text file. For more information, see "Verify the Design".

## Restricting Heights on Component Layers
You can create a board height restriction to limit the height of components placed on the board.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot use a height restriction of 0 (zero) to prevent placement on a layer. A height restriction of 0 specifies no restriction. To prevent placement of all components on a layer, make the layer a Routing layer instead of a Component layer in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you want to have a visual cue that a board has a height restriction, use the procedure in "Restricting Heights in Areas of Component Layers" to create a keepout area over the entire layer.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A board height restriction does not prevent placement of a decal that has no geometry.height attribute.
- No warning is given if you create a restriction after a component that is taller than the height restriction has been placed. The violation will be caught, however, when you run a clearance check in Verify Design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item, then click the **Text and Lines** tab.
- 2. In the Board component height restriction area, enter the height restriction for the Top and/or Bottom layer.
- 3. Click **OK**.

**Results**

You will be unable to place components whose geometry.height attribute value is greater than the specified height restriction.
