### Renaming a Net in ECO Mode
You can change the name of a net using the Rename Net ECO tool. This changes the netlist, is considered an engineering change and requires ECO mode.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from renaming a net in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Rename Net** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

- 2. Select a pin, unrouted pin pair, trace, or via in the net to rename.
- 3. In the Rename Net Dialog Box, type the new name, and click **OK**.

The maximum netname length is 47 characters. For more information, see "Illegal Characters in  Netnames and Part Names".

### Swapping ECL Terminators Automatically in ECO Mode
You can automatically swap ECL terminator assignments, or swap netnames between ECL pins.

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

This command ignores objects that are part of a physical design reuse. A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from swapping ECL terminators in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Terminator Assign** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

2. Click **Yes** to the displayed prompt.

### Swapping Gates
This section describes the processes used to swap gates manually or automatically.

Swapping a Gate Manually in ECO Mode Swapping All Gates Automatically in ECO Mode

#### Swapping a Gate Manually in ECO Mode
You can swap a gate with any equivalent gate to optimize routing and/or minimize trace lengths.

Gates are equivalent when:

- They share the same package.
- They have matching, nonzero Swap IDs.
- They have an equal pin count.

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot swap a gate that has any pins from a pin pair with rules.
- A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from swapping gates in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Swap Gate** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

2. Select a pin.

All candidates for swapping are highlighted. Candidates with a nonzero Swap ID that matches the selected pin's Swap ID are highlighted in the highlight color. Candidates with different or undefined Swap IDs are highlighted in a complementary color.

3. Select the highlighted pin to swap with.

**Results**

If the Stretch Traces During Component Move check box is selected (on the Options dialog box > Design categoryon page 1503), traces attached to pins of the swapped gates are rerouted. If Stretch Traces During Component Move is cleared, trace segments are unrouted before the swap is performed.

**Tip** You can undo your last Swap Gate command immediately after performing the swap. Right-click and click the **Undo Last Swap** popup menu item while still in Swap mode, or exit Swap mode and click the **Undo** button on the Standard Toolbar.

#### Swapping All Gates Automatically in ECO Mode
You can swap all gates with any equivalent gates based on shortest total unrouted pin pair lengths.

Gates are equivalent when:

- They share the same package.
- They have matching, nonzero Swap IDs.
- They have an equal pin count.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot swap a gate that has any pins from a pin pair with rules.

If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

2. Click the **Auto Swap Gate** button on the ECO Toolbar.

**Results**

If the Stretch Traces During Component Move check box is selected (on the Options dialog box > Design on page 1503), traces attached to pins of the swapped gates are rerouted. If Stretch Traces During Component Move is cleared, trace segments are unrouted before the swap is performed.

### Swapping Pins
This section describes the processes used to swap pins manually or automatically.

Swapping a Pin Manually in ECO Mode Swapping All Pins Automatically in ECO Mode

#### Swapping a Pin Manually in ECO Mode
You can swap a pin with any equivalent pin to optimize routing and/or minimize trace lengths. Pins are equivalent when they have matching, nonzero Swap IDs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot swap a pin that has any pins from a pin pair with rules.
- Connectors that are glued down are not included in the swap.
- A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from swapping pins in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Swap Pin** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click **OK** to use the ECO tools.)

2. Select a pin.

All candidates for swapping are highlighted. Candidates with a nonzero Swap ID that matches the selected pin's Swap ID are highlighted in the highlight color. Candidates with different or undefined Swap IDs are highlighted in a complementary color.

3. Select one of the highlighted pins with which to swap.

If you attempt to swap pins with undefined swap IDs or with different swap IDs, the Confirm Pin Swap Dialog Boxappears and you must confirm that the swap is legitimate. If these pins ought to be swappable, the correct process would be to give them identical swap IDs in the Pins tab of the Part Information dialog boxon page 1590.

4. Click **OK**.

**Results**

If the Stretch Traces During Component Move check box is selected (on the Options dialog box > Design categoryon page 1503), traces attached to pins of the swapped gates are rerouted. If Stretch Traces During Component Move is cleared, trace segments are unrouted before the swap is performed.

**Tip**

You can undo your last Swap Pin command immediately after performing the swap. Right-click and click the **Undo Last Swap** popup menu item while still in Swap mode, or exit Swap mode and click the **Undo** button on the Standard Toolbar.

### Copied Bridge Copper in ECO Mode
When you copy bridge copper in ECO mode and at least one assigned net trace with it, the pasted copy retains its bridge status and association to any attached trace(s). According to the circumstances of the pasted traces, their net names may be renamed or merged with existing net(s).

### Illegal Characters in Netnames and Part Names
You can use any alphanumeric character for netnames and part names, with a few noted exceptions.

The following characters are illegal in netnames:

- SpacesCommas (,)
- Braces ( { } )
- Asterisks (\*)
- Question marks (?)

The following characters are illegal in part names:

- SpacesCommas (,)
- Braces ( { } )
- Asterisks (\*)
- Question marks (?)
