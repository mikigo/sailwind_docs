# Chapter 36 ECO (Engineering Change Order)
As you develop new iterations of your design, you may need to create an ECO (Engineering Change Order) to capture the changes and forward or back annotate them between the schematic and the printed circuit board designs. This section discusses the purpose and use of Engineering Change Order operations.

## Engineering Change Order Operations
ECO operations include any processes that modifies the connection list or parts list. These operations include deleting, adding, and changing various aspects of decals, parts, nets, pin pairs, pad stacks, attributes, or design rules.

You must be in ECO mode before you can make such edits. In ECO mode, SailWind Layout can record your changes in a text file called the ECO file. You can use the ECO file as a reference to update, or back-annotate, the schematic.

## ECO Toolbar
The ECO Toolbar provides quick access to commands that allow you to create and update Engineering Change Orders associated with your design.

Use the ECO Toolbar to:

• Make engineering (netlist) changes to a schematic-driven design.

When laying out a schematic-driven design, you need to record any netlist changes you make in order to back-annotate them to the schematic. To do this, you work in ECO mode to record your changes, and use the ECO Toolbar tools to make the changes, which are saved in a text file called the ECO file (*.eco*). Then you use the ECO file to back-annotate the changes to the schematic.

You can also create an ECO file by using the Compare/ECO dialog box (**Tools** menu > **Compare/ECO** menu item).

• Create a layout-driven design.

In a layout-driven design (with no schematic), you use the tools in the ECO Toolbar to create the netlist (add parts and make connections). Since there is no schematic to back-annotate to, you do not need to save changes in an ECO file.

## Recorded Versus Generated ECO Files
It is always a best practice to record the engineering changes you make to your design. When you record the changes, an exact list is kept of the before and after change to objects.

For example, the *.eco* file will list that capacitor C42 was renamed to C71. If instead, you generate a list of engineering changes by simply comparing two designs, there is no way for the software to determine the changes that were made to parts that are electrically identical. If there are four identical capacitors in the design with identical connections, it might report that C28 changed to C71 when that isn't exactly what happened. Electrically, there's nothing wrong with these arbitrary decisions since the capacitors have the same value and are attached to the same nets. But if you compared how those capacitors are placed in the layout relative to how they're placed in the schematic, it might not make sense and it could lead you to be concerned that something terrible has occurred with the synchronization of the design.

So, depending on how you create the *.eco* file, a renumbered back annotation can have different effects, one of which can be inconvenient to cross probing or double-checking the results of the renumbering comparing the schematics to the layout. Using a recorded *.eco* file is the best option and can be used in all three methods of back annotation including manual and automated methods. If you record the renumbering of the reference designators in the *.eco* file while you use the autorenumber tool, you will have a perfect (was...is) before and after listing of the changed reference designators.

But if you generate the *.eco* by comparing netlists, you will not have an exact (was...is) before and after list of the discretes in the schematic. Discretes that are identical components and have identical net connections are indistinguishable in the netlist. Electrically the changes will be correct. But since there is no placement information in netlists, an *.eco* file generated by comparison won't be able to determine the exact refdes exchange of these discretes.

## Recording ECO Changes
If you are working on a schematic-driven design, you will need to back-annotate design changes to the schematic. You can record your netlist changes and then save them to an ECO file.

**Procedure**

1. On the Standard Toolbar click the **ECO Toolbar** button.

If the ECO Options dialog box does not appear, click the **ECO Options** button on the ECO Toolbar to open it.

- 2. In the ECO Options dialog box:
	- a. Select the "Write ECO file" check box.
	- b. Make sure that the pathname of the *.eco* file in the "Filename" text box is correct. (If the file does not exist, it is created and recorded changes are written to it. Existing *.eco* files are left untouched.)
	- c. If the *.eco* file already exists, specify what to do with it:
		- To append ECO changes you make in this session to the existing file, select the Append to file check box.
		- To overwrite the existing file with the changes you make in this session, clear the Append to file check box.
- d. Specify when ECO changes will be saved:
	- To be able to save ECO changes incrementally during the session, so you can view them in the ECO file, select the Write ECO file after closing ECO toolbox check box.
	- To save ECO changes only when you save the *.pcb* file, open a new file, or exit SailWind Layout, clear the Write ECO file after closing ECO toolbox check box.
- e. Set the other options as appropriate. See the "ECO Options Dialog Box" topic.
- f. Click **OK**.

**Results**

Any netlist changes you make are recorded. If you have selected the Write ECO file after closing ECO toolbox check box, the changes are written to the ECO file when you close the ECO toolbox; otherwise they are saved when you save the design, open a new file, or exit the software.

If you clear the Write ECO file or the Write ECO file after closing ECO toolbox check box during a session, all recorded change data, both in memory and in the ECO file, are deleted.

Backward Annotation from SailWind Layout to SailWind Logic

## ECO-Registered Parts
A part is ECO-registered when you edit the part with the Library Manager, select ECO Registered Part on the General tab of the Part Information dialog box, and then save the part to the library. Once a part has been assigned the ECO Registered status, it can be identified for inclusion or exclusion during the ECO update processes.

When updating a design with changes from a schematic or updating a schematic with changes from a design, you can exclude or include non-ECO-registered parts from ECO processing. In the ECO Options Dialog Box, do one of the following:

- If you want ECO processing to exclude non-ECO-registered parts, select the "Output Only ECO Registered Parts" check box.
- If you want ECO processing to include non-ECO-registered parts, which includes non-electrical parts, clear the "Output Only ECO Registered Parts" check box.

You must be in ECO mode to add, delete, rename, or alter a part regardless of whether it is registered or not.

Avoid connecting non-ECO-registered parts, such as mechanical hardware, to ECO-registered netlist items, such as GND. A conflict may occur when an ECO-registered item is connected to a non-ECOregistered item.

## ECO-Registered Attributes
Both ECO-registered and non-ECO-registered attributes can be added, deleted, or changed in ECO mode.

To turn on ECO Registration for attributes, use the Objects tab of the Attribute Properties dialog box on page 1111. Also turn on ECO Registration for any attributes you want to backward annotate to the schematic. Via attributes are not registered attributes, therefore you can add, delete, or change them in ECO mode or non-ECO mode.

You can exclude non-ECO-registered attributes from ECO processing by clearing the "Compare Only ECO Registered Attributes" check box in the **Comparison** tab of the Compare/ECO Tools dialog box on page 1181.

When updating a design from a schematic, a report automatically appears indicating the ECO registration of imported attributes. When an attribute does not exist in the Attribute Dictionary, it is added with ECO registration turned off. If the attribute already exists in the dictionary, the existing attribute and ECO registration in the dictionary are used.

## ECO Mode Operations (Layout-Driven Design Tools)
This section describes specific operations that you can perform only in ECO mode.

**CAUTION:**

A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from making ECO changes. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

### Predefined Netnames
When you add a net to the design using the Add Route, Add Connection, or Copy Route command, the Derive Net Name from Pin Function shortcut menu option controls how the added net is named. When this option is enabled, the pin's pin name determines the net name. If no pin name exists, or this option is disabled, the net name is automatically generated.

Use the Derive Net Name from Pin Function option when creating the design on the fly instead of creating the design from the netlist generated by the schematic tool. For example, in a typical BGA design you manually connect each die part's substrate bond pad to a BGA component pad using the Add Route or

Add Connection command. To give the added net a meaningful name, enable Derive Net Name from Pin Function to derive the net name from the die part pin name, for example, GND.

### Added Connection
When adding connections, the command behavior is dependent upon the condition of the pins that are being connected such as pins not in a net, one pin in a net, one pin defined as an output or merging nets.

In example 1 shown in Figure 110, Pin 1 and Pin 2 are not in a net. A pin name (function) exists for one of the pins.

<span id="page-5-1"></span>Connecting Pin 1 and Pin 2 opens the Define Name of Net dialog box.

<span id="page-5-2"></span>Clicking Add Pins to OUTPUT in the Define Name of Net dialog box adds Pin 1 and Pin 2 to netname OUTPUT \(Figure 111).

**Figure 111. Added Pin 1 and Pin 2 to Netname OUTPUT**

### Adding a Connection in ECO Mode
When you create a new pin pair in your design and it will change the current netlist. ECO Mode captures this change and preserves it for later back annotation to the schematic. While adding the new connection, you have a number of naming options available.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Add Connection** button0

If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click **OK** to use the ECO tools.

2. Select the first pin in the connection.

While adding a connection:

- You can right-click and click the **Rename Current Net** popup menu item to rename the net of the current pin. In the Rename Net prompt, type the new name and click **OK**. The maximum netname length is 47 characters. For more information, see "Illegal Characters in Netnames  and Part Names".
- You can rename the net of the current pin, as follows:
	- To use the pin function as the net name, right-click and click the **Derive Net Name from Pin Function** popup menu item. For more information, see "Predefined Netnames".
	- To type in a new name, right-click and click the **Rename Current Net** popup menu item. In the Rename Net prompt type the new name, and click **OK**. The maximum netname length is 47 characters. For more information, see "Illegal Characters in Netnames and Part  Names."
	- To use the pin function as the net name, right-click and click the **Derive Net Name from Pin Function** popup menu item. For more information, see "Predefined Netnames."
- To type in a new name, right-click and click the **Rename Current Net** popup menu item. In the Rename Net prompt, type the new name, and click **OK**. The maximum netname length is 47 characters. For more information, see "Illegal Characters in Netnames and Part  Names."
- 3. Select the second pin in the connection.

If you are connecting to a pin of a different net (merging two nets), the Define Name of Merged Net Dialog Boxappears. Choose or type a new netname. (Netnames are automatically generated for each newly created connection.) For more information, see "Predefined Netnames"on page 817.

4. Click another pin to continue adding connections to this net, or right-click and click the **Cancel**  popup menu item to stop.

### Adding a Route in ECO Mode
You can create routes that add to or change the current netlist, or that end a route on a segment with a different netname.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_7_Picture_9.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Add Route** button.

If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click **OK** to use the ECO tools.

- 2. Select the pin at which to start the trace.
- 3. Begin routing.

Add corners and vias as described in "Routing Manually". You can also use the shortcut menu to control routing operations. While routing:

• You can rename the net of the current pin. Right-click and click the **Rename Current Net**  popup menu item. In the Rename Net prompt type the new name, and click **OK**. The maximum netname length is 47 characters. For more information, see "Illegal Characters in Netnames  and Part Names".

As an alternative you can use the pin function as the net name. Right-click and click the **Derive Net Name from Pin Function** popup menu item. For more information, see "Predefined Netnames".

• Right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item to exit Add Route mode.

- With Online DRC disabled, the pointer changes to a bull's-eye when it is near any eligible completion point, regardless of the net.
- With On-line DRC in Prevent errors modeon page 1503, when routing a trace between pins that are not part of the same net or that have no netlist, all items are considered obstacles. To connect to the pin, right-click and click the **Select Target** popup menu item and select the pin at which you want to end the trace.
- If you are connecting to a pin of a different net (that is, merging two nets), the Define Name of Merged Net Dialog Boxappears. Choose or type a new netname. (Netnames are automatically generated for each new connection.) For more information, see "Predefined Netnames."
- 4. Select the pin on which to end the trace.

### Adding a Component in ECO Mode
You can add a new component to your design in ECO Mode and it will change the current netlist. ECO Mode captures this change and preserves it for later back annotation to the schematic.

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot add a decal to a design if the design is in default layer mode and the decal to be added is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.
- A part must be ECO-registeredon page 1824 to be included in the ECO file. You set the ECO registration for parts in the Part Information dialog boxon page 1590.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Add Component** button.

If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click **OK** to use the ECO tools.

2. In the Get Part Type from Library Dialog Box, to filter the part types, in the filter area, type a wildcard or expressionon page 155 in the Items box and click **Apply**.

If the Filter Items box is blank, no items will be displayed. Add an asterisk (\*) to see all items of the library or library partition in the Part Types list.

3. Select the part name in the Part Types list box and click **Add** to attach the component to the pointer.

- If the selected part type already exists in the design with the specified name, the message "Part Type <name> already exists in design. Loading from Library is skipped, design's Part Type will be used" appears. Click **OK** to continue. Go to step 4.
- If the specified part type does not exist in the design, but the decal name does exist, the message "Decal(s) <name> already exists in design. Loading of decal(s) from Library is skipped, design's data will be used" appears. This message appears only if the number of terminals in the library part and the design part are the same. Click **OK** to continue. Go to step 4.
- If the specified part type does not exist, and the number of terminals in the new decal does not match the number of terminals in the existing decal, the message "Decal <name> already exists in design. Library decal has different number of terminals than decal in design. Aborting Get Part Type from Library" appears. The Add Part process cancels in this case.
- If the number of terminals does not match in the alternate decals, the message "Library Part Type <library name:part type name> has decals with different number of terminals. Aborting Get Part Type from Library" appears. The Add Part process cancels in this case.
- 4. Click **Close** to close the dialog box.
- 5. Optional: Assign a reference designator.

Unless you assign a reference designator, the new part is automatically annotated with the next available reference designator. You can change the reference designator before placing the new component. Right-click and click the **Rename Current Part** popup menu item. In the Rename Part prompt, type the new reference designator, and click **OK**.

6. Move the part to the appropriate location and click to place the part.

### AutoRenumber Sweeps
The AutoRenumber result depends on the matrix created by the cell size and the directional pattern of the renumbering sweep. The values used in the Cell Size area of the AutoRenumber dialog box allow you to create custom renumbering sweeps of the board. Here we provide two usage examples and then recommend a best practice.

You can select one of eight different directional numbering patterns. Choose the pattern that best suits the orientation and shape of your board.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 114. AutoRenumber Patterns**

**Wide Sweep Example**

In this example, you accept the default Cell Size settings of the AutoRenumber dialog box. The On x and On y values are set to encompass your entire board. This produces one long, wide sweep. The result of using a wide sweep frequently results in unexpected numbering of the reference designators.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_10_Figure_5.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_10_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Narrow Sweep Example**

In this example, you type a small value for the On y value of the Cell Size. The On y value is something small like 10 mils and it catches even the smallest variations in the alignment of components. The result of using a sweep that is too narrow results in numbering of components that don't appear to be offset.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 116. Narrow Sweep Results**

**Best Practice**

Based on the examples shown, the best practice to follow with renumbering is to create cells that do span your entire board, but in narrow sweeps. You may need to adjust the width of your sweep to achieve the desired result. When renumbering, the sweep uses the bottom pin of components as the origin.

For example, your board measures 4000 mils wide and 2000 mils high. You are renumbering left to right, top to bottom. You want to set your cell size to On x=4000 and On y=10.

**Tip**

If the reference designator renumbering isn't exactly perfect, you can always manually renumber a few components that weren't renumbered according to what you expected.

Changing the Reference Designators of Multiple Components in ECO Mode \(Autorenumbering\)

### Changing the Reference Designators of Multiple Components in ECO Mode (Autorenumbering)
After you complete the final placement of a design, you can renumber the parts to order the reference designators in a recognizable pattern, such as top to bottom, left to right. This makes it easier to find a component on a fabricated board.

Autorenumbering is an ECO operation, so you must start ECO mode before you can autorenumber parts. The resulting ECO file contains part name changes for backward annotation to the associated design file.

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_11_Picture_13.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

If you are renumbering a schematic-driven design that will be back-annotated to the schematic, you must record the autorenumber operation by checking the Write ECO file check box in the ECO Options dialog box before you renumber. Recording the exact changes in an *.eco* file gives the best back annotation results. For more information, see "Recorded Versus Generated ECO Files".

![](/layout/guide/36/_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from changing a reference designator. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.
- Jumpers are excluded from autorenumbering.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Auto Renumber** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

- 2. In the AutoRenumber Dialog Box, make sure the reference designation prefixes you want to use are selected in Prefix List. You must select at least one prefix.
- 3. In the Cell Size area, type the matrix size for the renumbering sweep.

For information about selecting cell sizes and renumbering patterns, see "AutoRenumber Sweeps".

- 4. Make your renumbering choices in the Precedence area:
	- For designs with parts on both top and bottom, select the "Continuous numbering side to side" check box to number all parts sequentially. In "Start Renumbering From" click either Top or Bottom.
	- For the Top and/or Bottom, select the Renumber check box and indicate the "Start at" value and the Increment value if applicable.
	- Click a renumbering pattern button for one or both sides.
- 5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

Are the results not what you expected? Click **Edit > Undo** to undo the renumbering and start over. (You many want to revisit the "AutoRenumber Sweeps".)
