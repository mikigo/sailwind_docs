### Changing a Component in ECO Mode
Use Change Component to change the part type of one or more components, or all part types of the same name, to the part type of another component in the design or to a part type in the library.

The updated part type may contain a different decal assignment which can affect routing in the design. You can also update the part type with a newer version from the libraryon page 827.

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from changing a component in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.
- You cannot add a decal to a design if the design is in default layer mode and the decal to add is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Change Component** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

- 2. Type DRO and press the Enter key to turn off On-line DRC (Design Rules Checking).
- 3. Select the component or components whose part type you want to change.

To select a single component, click the component in the design area. To select multiple components, right-click and click the **Find** popup menu item to use the Find dialog box. For more information, see the "Find Objects dialog boxon page 1378" topic.

- 4. Change the component using one of the following:
	- a. To change the component to a different part type from the design, click the component whose part type you want to use as the replacement.
	- b. To change the component to a part type from the library, right-click and click the **Library Browse** popup menu item. The Get Part Type from Library Dialog Box appears. To filter the part types, in the filter area, type a wildcard or expressionon page 155 in the Items box and click **Apply**. Locate and select the item, and then click **Replace**.
		- If the selected part type already exists in the design with the specified name, the message "Part Type <name> already exists in design. Loading from Library is skipped, design's Part Type will be used" appears. Click **OK** to continue.
- 5. In the Change Component Dialog Box, you are prompted to confirm the change. Select the Keep Attributes check box if you want to retain the attributes of the part in the design.
- 6. If the modified Part Type changes the PCB decal or contains different pin numbers, you must map the old decal pin numbers to the new decal pin numbers in the Assign Pin Numbers Dialog Box.on page 1104

**Results**

Change Component retains test points if the pin position is the same and the new terminal still has pads on the testing side; otherwise the test point is removed.

### Updating a Part Type from the Library in ECO Mode
You can update part type data from a new version in the library. The updated part type may contain a different decal assignment which can affect routing in the design.

You can also change a componenton page 826 to another part type in the design or in the library.

**CAUTION:**

When you modify or delete design objects, electrical nets are regenerated. This can cause existing electrical nets that include these objects to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot add a decal to a design if the design is in default layer mode and the decal to add is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.
- A protected route or physical design reuse element can prevent you from updating a part type in ECO mode. You must unprotect the route or break the reuse to proceed. If you are recording changes to an ECO file, the action of removing the protection on traces or breaking out reuse elements is not saved.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar > Change Component** button.

(If this is the first time in the current session you are using the ECO Toolbar, the ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. Set the options you want and click OK to use the ECO tools.)

- 3. Select the component or components whose part type you want to update.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Library Browse** popup menu item.
- 5. In the Get Part Type from Library Dialog Box, select the Update Part Type from Library check box to update the selected part type with a new library definition of the same name.

The search locates and automatically highlights the library definition for the selected part type.

6. Click **Replace**.

- 7. If there are additional components with the selected part type that you did not select in the design, you are prompted with the message, "Part type <name> will be replaced with Library item for ALL parts of this type in the design". Click **OK**. Note that you must update all components that use the same part type.
- 8. You are prompted to confirm the change. Select the Keep Attributes check box if you want to retain attributes.
- 9. If the modified Part Type changes the PCB decal or contains different pin numbers, you must map the old decal pin numbers to the new decal pin numbers in the Assign Pin Numbers Dialog Box.on page 1104

**Results**

Change Component retains test points if the pin position is the same and the new terminal still has pads on the testing side; otherwise the test point is removed.
