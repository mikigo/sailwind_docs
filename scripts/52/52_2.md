## SailWind Router Link Dialog Box
**To access: Tools > SailWind Router**

The contents of the SailWind Router Link dialog box depend on your Synchronization mode settings.

**Description**

When you are not in Synchronization mode, the SailWind Router Link sets up autorouting options for SailWind Router and passes information from SailWind Layout to SailWind Router. Data is stored in the design file. Using the link you can either run SailWind Router and automatically open the current design file in the foreground, so you can view the autorouter's progress, or you can run SailWind Router in the background.

When you are in Synchronization mode, the SailWind Router link sets up autorouting options for SailWind Router and switch to SailWind Router. Using the link you can either run SailWind Router and automatically open the current design file in the foreground, so you can view the autorouter's progress, or you can run SailWind Router in the background.

| Action       | Specifies the action you want to perform. The options are:<br>• Open SailWind Router — Opens SailWind Router and loads<br>the design file into it. You can make changes to the design file<br>in SailWind Router (rather than SailWind Layout) before routing.<br>Non-Synchronization mode only.                                  |

Adding and Modifying Part Type Attributes

## Part Information Dialog Box, Connector Tab
To access: **File> Library** menu item > select a library > **Parts** button > select part > **New** or **Edit** button > **Connector** tab

Use the **Connector** tab in the Part Information dialog box to assign one or more pin decals, or Special Symbols, to a connector. This allows you to use any of the special symbols as alternate pins of the connector. Instead of being displayed as a single symbol, the connector is broken up into individual pin symbols in the schematic. You can place the pins all together, or wherever you like on a single page, or even across multiple pages.

**Restriction:**

This tab is unavailable when the Connector check box on the **General** tab is cleared, or when a gate has been assigned to the part on the **Gates** tab.
