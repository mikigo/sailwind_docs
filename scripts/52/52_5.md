## Place Clusters Setup Dialog Box
To access: **Tools > Cluster Placement** menu item > **Place Clusters** button > **Setup** button

Use the Place Clusters Setup dialog box to place the clusters based on connectivity and topology. Place Clusters treats all top-level objects with glued members as glued. Place Clusters assumes that pin positions of top-level cluster members are located in the center of the top-level cluster regardless of the glued member positions.

| Attempts per Iteration     | Within each iteration, attempts are made to position parts, minimize net<br>lengths, reduce part overlaps, and keep parts inside the board outline.<br>Increase this value to group parts closer together and closer to glued<br>parts during an iteration. |
| Percent from Part Swapping | During each iteration, parts, clusters, and unions are either swapped<br>with other parts or repositioned to improve placement. Use this feature<br>to increase the amount of swapping that occurs instead of moving<br>parts.                              |

## Plane Layer Nets Dialog Box
To access: **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item > select a plane layer > **Assign Nets** button

Use the Plane Layer Nets dialog box to assign or unassign nets with plane layers. CAM (Negative) planes should only have one net assigned. Split/Mixed may have multiple nets assigned. Plane layers contain large copper areas that components can access for ground and power. CAM output produces thermal relief connection pads for nets associated with the plane layer.

## Plot Options Dialog Box
To access:

- **File> CAM** menu item > **Add** button > **Options** button
- **File> CAM** menu item > select a document name > **Edit** button > **Options** button. If you selected NC Drill as the Document Type, the NC Drill Options Dialog Boxopens instead.

Use this dialog box to set plotting options.

**Note:** You can also use this dialog box to gain access to the "Drill Symbols dialog box"on page 1334.

**Description**

Use the Plot Positioning settings to create the best view of your design on the page that you print or pen plot. But more importantly, use the Plot Positioning settings to ensure that all the documents of the layers of your design align perfectly with one another. The most efficient way to correctly align your layers involves using board or global fiducials and using the two-adjacent-sides types of plot justification.

Use the Preview window to help determine the correct positioning with regard to your output - whether a file or a page.

**Tip** Jumper pins of SMD jumpers are output on the paste mask layer, similar to SMD component output.

| Draw Chart           | Specifies to include the drill chart in the plot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| X/Y Location         | Specifies the location of the drill chart in design units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Process Status Dialog Box
To access: Compare/ECO dialog boxon page 1185 > select Generate ECO File check box > click **Run**.

Use the Process Status dialog box to monitor the *.eco* (and *.asc*) generation progress, display the reports, or cancel the process being run by the Compare/ECO process when creating an *.eco* file.

**Description**

This dialog box has two different views depending on whether Forward Annotation or Backward Annotation are occurring.

- **Forward Annotation dialog**  described in Table 193.
- **Backward Annotation dialog**  described in Table 194.

## Project Explorer
To access: Click the **Project Explorer** button. The Project Explorer is not available in the PCB Decal Editor.

The Project Explorer shows a hierarchical structure for the objects in your design. It provides access to objects and rules. When you update your design, the hierarchical structure updates automatically to reflect the changes you make.

![](/layout/guide/52/_page_85_Picture_4.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/52/_page_85_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Objects**

In the right-click menu, if you enable the "Expand all on selection" option, the corresponding branch is expanded when an object is selected in the design. For example you select a net in the design and it expands the Nets branch of the Project Explorer.

Objects in the Project Explorer are placed in object groups. Object groups are of two types: primary and secondary. You cannot remove or rename primary object groups. Modification of secondary group items is only available in SailWind Router.

The following table lists and describes the primary and secondary object groups.

| Primary Group          | Secondary Group   | Description                                                                               |
