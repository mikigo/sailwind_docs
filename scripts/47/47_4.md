To access: This dialog box is displayed when you use the Cluster Placement dialog box to automatically build new clusters, place clusters within the board outline, and place parts within the board outline.

The Cluster Placement Status dialog box displays the percentage of completion for each pass that you enable using Setup. The right side of this dialog box displays estimated and elapsed time for placement passes.

## Collaboration Data Import Dialog Box
To access: In the Markups Dialog Box, click the **Import** button, browse to and select a file, then click **Open**

Use the Collaboration Data Import dialog box to target any imported 2D lines to a specific documentation layer. Collaboration data often includes markups that are physically associated with the issues. The markups are imported as 2D lines to the documentation layer selected in the dialog box.

## Compare/ECO Tools Dialog Box, Comparison Tab
To access: **Tools > Compare/ECO Tools** menu item > **Comparison** tab

Use the **Comparison** tab on the Compare/ECO Tools dialog box to specify the elements to include in the design comparison.

**Tip** During design comparison, SailWind Layout ignores the reuse definitionon page 1854 and uses the actual elements in the physical design reuse.
