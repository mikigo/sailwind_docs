## Component Layer Associations Dialog Box
To access: **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item > **Associations** button

Use the Component Layer Associations dialog box to associate, or otherwise map, which documentation layers go with the selected layer when a top or bottom layer is set as a component layer.

**Description**

The layer associations made in this dialog box are used by CAM routines for output. For example, when you output a silkscreen for the top, any items on the documentation layer you associated for silkscreen are automatically added to the CAM document.

## Component Properties Dialog Box
To access:

- Select a component > right-click > **Properties**
- Select a component > Standard Toolbar > **Properties** button
- Select a component > press the Ctrl-Q (or Alt-Enter) keys

Use the Component Properties dialog box to modify component placement, decal, cluster, label and electrical net information.

**Description**

There are three tabs that change the content displayed in the dialog box:

- Use the **Part** tab in the Component Properties dialog box to view all information about the part. This is not editable.
- Use the **Cluster** tab in the Component Properties dialog box to exclude clusters or set one as a base cluster.
- Use the **Labels** tab in the Component Properties dialog box to specify the label you want to create or edit, and to open the Part Label Properties dialog box, where you can set the label properties.

Use the Electrical Nets area to make electrical nets settings.

|                    | CAUTION:<br>You can assign decals using this dialog box outside of ECO mode<br>on page 1824.

## Conditional Rule Setup Dialog Box
To access: **Setup> Design Rules** menu item > **Conditional Rules** button

Use the Conditional Rule Setup dialog box to setup clearance and high-speed rules that come into effect only when objects named in the rule are adjacent or on a specific layer. For example, the default clearance between nets is X, but when net A is adjacent to net B, the clearance is Y.

**Note:** The Advanced Rules option is required to setup conditional design rules.
