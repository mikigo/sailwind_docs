## Basic Script Editor Dialog Box
To access: **Tools > Basic Scripts> Basic Script Editor** menu item

Basic is a simple scripting language. Like many Windows applications, such as Microsoft Word and Excel, PADS applications include Basic capabilities to allow users to customize their applications using a standard scripting language.

You can use the Basic Script Editor to create, edit, run, and troubleshoot Basic scripts from PADS applications.

| Fanout Style list | Sets the fanout pattern. The available fanout styles depend on the grid<br>array geometry. Herringbone and Diagonal are available for regular<br>(non-staggered) arrays. Vortex and Double Vortex are available for<br>staggered arrays. |
| Direction area    | • Out — Turns BGA fanouts to the outside of the design.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                   | • In — Turns BGA fanouts to the inside of the design.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                   | • Clockwise — Turns BGA fanouts in a clockwise direction.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                   | • Counterclockwise — Turns BGA fanouts in a counterclockwise<br>direction.                                                                                                                                                               |
|                   | If either Orthogonal for Outside Row or Orthogonal for Inside Row<br>is selected, the direction options only affect BGA fanouts within the<br>central rows when more than two rows of BGA pads exist.                                    |

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orthogonal for Outside Row | Turns BGA fanouts on the outside row outward at an orthogonal angle<br>with respect to the die. If this option is selected, the Direction options<br>have no effect on the outside row.                      |
| Orthogonal for Inside Row  | Turns BGA fanouts on the inside row inward at an orthogonal angle in<br>respect to the die. If this option is selected, the Direction options have<br>no affect on the inside row.                           |
| Trace Width                | Defines the trace width to use for BGA fanouts. The trace width must<br>adhere to the minimum and maximum rule set in the Clearance Rules<br>Dialog Box.<br>See also: "Design Rule Hierarchy".               |
| Via Type list              | Defines the via type to use for BGA fanouts. The list contains the vias<br>that are defined for this design using Setup> Pad Stacks.                                                                         |
| Preview Window             | Shows the fanout pattern defined by the current settings on the BGA<br>Fanouts tab. In this window you can see that pads excluded from<br>processing on the Select Pads tab do not receive a fanout pattern. |
|                            | Tip<br>If Existing Nets on the Connections tab or Routing tab is selected,<br>all pads, including pads that are not currently part of a predefined<br>connection, are assigned a fanout pattern.             |
