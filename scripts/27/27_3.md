### Combining Line and Text Objects
You can combine text objects and line objects to form one group. When you combine objects, you can select and move them as one item and save it to the library. When you move an object that is combined with other objects, all the combined objects move. You can use the Combine command in both the Layout Editor and in the Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use Shift-click to select the entire drafting shape that you want to combine.
- 2. When the shape is highlighted, use Ctrl+click to select the text to combine.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item. You cannot combine text objects without including a drafting object.

**Results**

Once you combine objects, selection characteristics change for each object. When you Shift-click a shape, the whole shape and the text are selected for action. You can reposition the combined objects or save them to the libraryon page 647 as one unit. If you select the text, however, only text is highlighted for editing or repositioning.

You can remove an object from the combination using **Uncombine** from the shortcut menu. You can uncombine the entire combination using **Explode** from the shortcut menu.

## Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
You can join and close 2D lines and copper shapes so that changes applied to one object apply to all of the joined objects.

Use Join and Close to Connect 2D Lines and Copper Shapes Joining 2D Lines and Copper Shapes Closing 2D Lines and Copper Shapes Breaking an Object

### Use Join and Close to Connect 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use Join and Close commands to connect 2D lines and copper shapes to create single objects for the purpose of changing their properties. For example, you can create a closed 2D line and then change its properties to "copper."

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** These commands are especially useful for after you have imported a *.dxf* file.

You can use Join and Close when the line ends are "near enough": meaning: touching, crossing slightly, or perfectly matched. If the lines are not touching or crossed too far, Join and Close will not work.

**Examples of Near Enough**

Join and Close will work on any of the following examples:

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_11.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_12.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_15.jpeg)

**Examples of Not Near Enough**

Join and Close will NOT work on either of the following examples:

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_32_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Limitations**

You cannot join or close when the selection includes:

- Objects that are not 2D lines (for example, a keepout)
- 2D Line shapes on different layers
- 2D Lines that are part of a reuse
- 2D Lines that are closed or a circle
- More than one connection available with the same distance

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_32_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Note:**

The connection is available if both ends are not already connected with a smaller distance.

• Shapes that cannot be joined or closed into single shape. For example, you cannot do a multiple Join or Close.

### Joining 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use the Join command to connect any 2D lines or copper shapes that are "near enough."

For more information, see "Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes".

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the two 2D lines or copper shapes you want to join. The objects must be near enough.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Join** popup menu item.
- If two segments cross near enough to their ends, the two segments are shortened and the cross point is the point where they are joined
- If the segments do not cross, an additional segment is added

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "2D Line" in the Status bar. You can now select the entire joined object.

If the command did not work, you should see the error message: "Join command aborted" in the Output Window.

### Closing 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use the Close command to create a closed (and joined) shape that has contiguous lines. The objects must be "near enough" for the command to be effective.

For more information, see "Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes."

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the 2D lines or copper shapes you want to close. The objects must be near enough.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Close** popup menu item.

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "2D Line" in the Status bar. You can now select the entire closed object.

If the command did not work, you should see the error message: "Close command aborted" in the Output Window.

### Breaking an Object
You can break any 2D Line or copper shape that is not a single straight line or a single arc into multiple 2D Lines. The Break command creates a "break point" at every corner of the shape.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot break a circle or elements that belong to a reuse.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object you want to break.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Break** popup menu item.

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "Multiple Selection" in the Status bar. You can now select each segment separately.

## Saving a Drafting Item to a Library
Add drafting items to your library so you can reuse them in a current design or any other design. SailWind Layout stores all of the objects with the Lines filter in the Library.

**Procedure**

1. Press the Shift key and select the item to select the whole shape rather than a segment or corner of the shape.

You can select a board outline, 2-D lines, copper objects, keepout objects, and dimension objects. You cannot save text alone to the library. Text must be combinedon page 642 with a 2D line in order to save it to the library.

- 2. Right-click and click the **Save to Library** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Save to Library dialog box, select the library you want, and type the name of the item.
- 4. Click **OK**.

The drafting item is in the Library. Use the Lines filter in the Library Manager to find the item for future use.
