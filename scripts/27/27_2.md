## Scaling 2D Line Objects and Dimensions
Use Scale in the 2D line or Dimension object Properties to change the size of objects.

An arc is too large if its radius is greater than 14 inches or its center is outside the database coordinate area. The database coordinate area is (-28, -28) to (28, 28) inches. Arcs are approximated with multiple straight segments.

When you scale text or dimensions, combine them with other line objects. Line widths are not scaled.

When combined text or dimension text is scaled, the maximum text height is 1000 mils and the maximum text width is 50 mils.

**Location of Scaled Objects**

If the scale model contains multiple objects and you want to maintain their relative positions, combine the objects before using Scale.

In the following figure, the two noncombined objects are scaled. The objects have individual origins, as shown on the left. These different origins are used when scaling, creating overlapping objects, as shown on the right.

**Figure 76. Noncombined Objects**

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_20_Figure_12.jpeg)

In the following figure, the two combined objects are scaled. The objects have a single origin, as shown on the left. This origin is used when scaling, creating a larger copy of the original objects, as shown on the right.

Converting Drafting Shapes Changing Line Widths Scaling Filling a Shape with Solid Copper Changing Layers

#### Converting Drafting Shapes
You can convert a closed drafting object to another shape. In the Layout Editor, you can convert any closed drafting object to a 2D line, board outline, board cut out, copper, copper cut out, keepout, or copper plane. In the PCB Decal Editor, you can convert any closed drafting object to a 2D line, copper, copper cut out, or keepout.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When converting shapes, the following restrictions apply:

- If there is no board outline in the design, the Board Cut Out type does not appear in the Drafting Properties dialog box Type list. You must first have a board outline before you can create a board cut out.
- If there is already a board outline in the design, the Board Outline option does not appear in the dialog box because you cannot have two board outlines.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Type list, select a new shape type.

**Tip** The Copper Cut Out type is also used for cut outs in Copper Planes.

#### Changing Line Widths
You can modify the line width of drafting object outlines and fill lines as applicable.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Drafting Properties Dialog Box, in the Width box, type a value.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Restriction:** Some drafting object line widths cannot be changed.

**Note:** Like any other line width, the chamfered path does not appear as the correct width if the Minimum display width option for the design is larger than the Polygon outline width of the path. The path appears more narrow by the value of the Polygon outline width.

#### Scaling
Resize a drafting object.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item.
- 2. The object will scale up or down from the origin of the shape. If necessary, right-click and click the Set Originon page 474 popup menu item to set the origin of the scale model.
- 3. Right-click, and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 4. In the Drafting Properties Dialog Box, set scale options.

Enter a floating-point number greater than 0. Fractions are not supported. Values greater than 1 will increase the size while values less than 1 will shrink the object. A scale value of 2 will double the shape's size, a scale value of 0.5 will halve the shape's size. The line width does not scale.

5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

• If scaling changes a dimension, select the dimension, right-click, and click the **Reset Measurement** popup menu item to update the dimension measurement.

#### Filling a Shape with Solid Copper
SailWind Layout fills copper using the settings of the Copper Hatch Grid and the Drafting Default width. If desired, you can ignore these settings and fill a shape with solid copper. When you create chamfered paths, they appear as solid copper.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a copper drafting object, right-click and then click the **Properties** popup menu item
- 2. In the Drafting Properties dialog boxon page 1328, select the **Solid Copper** check box.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_26_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** The Solid Copper check box forces copper to use trace clearance rules.

#### Changing Layers
You can change the layer on which the drafting object exists.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. Drafting Properties Dialog Box, in the Layer list, select the new layer.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_26_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** Moving assigned copper to a nonelectrical layer removes the connection from the copper shape. Place the copper back on an electrical layer to reassign the connections.

### Moving a Miter
You can expand or contract a miter or arc on a drafting segment with the Move Miter command.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a miter segment or arc, right-click, and then click the **Move Miter** popup menu item. The object dynamically attaches to your pointer.
- 2. Move the pointer to expand or contract the object.
- 3. Click to indicate the new miter position to finish. Indicate a location outside the point of intersection of the two lines to convert the arc or miter back to a corner.
- 4. Use the Stretch Commandto modify an arc or miter on a route.

**Restriction:**

You cannot modify, move, or delete a polygon of any type (2D line, copper, or copper plane) that is part of a physical design reuse. If you try to otherwise modify a polygon, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.
