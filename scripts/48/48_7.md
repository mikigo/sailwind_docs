## Drafting Edge Properties Dialog Box
To access: Select a drafting edge > right-click > **Properties** popup menu item

Use the Drafting Edge Properties dialog box to view and edit an object type, layer assignment, trace clearance, or assigned net.

**Description**

You can move an edge by coordinates or an arc by radius or start/end angle, access net information, and select the parent shape. The following are exceptions:

- For circles, you can change only Center Point and Radius.
- For arcs, use the X1,Y1 and X2,Y2 fields as the arc end points. To define an arc, you only need a subset of these fields. To redefine the arc, change only one field at a time. If you make a change that cannot be interpreted, the command is canceled.

Modifying Drafting Edge Properties

## Drafting Properties Dialog Box
To access: Choose a drafting shape, right-click and choose **Properties**

You can select and edit an entire drafting shape or a part of the shape. The properties you can edit depend on whether you select a corner of the drafting object, an edge of the drafting object, the entire drafting object, or the parent object.

**Restriction:**

Several of the options in this dialog box are unavailable if the object is part of a physical design reuse.

| Quantity<br>column        | Displays the count of each drill size in the design. It may contain a zero value for<br>drill sizes loaded from the cam.defaults file, or for alternate drill sizes contained<br>in the design database, but not currently used in the design.                                                |
| Plated column             | The Plated column displays whether the plating type for each drill size is plated<br>(Yes) or non-plated (No). Duplicate drill sizes can appear in the table if each has<br>a unique plating type.                                                                                            |

|                           | • When this column displays, if both through and partial drills of a given drill<br>size exist, they are counted separately and appear in separate rows. When<br>this column does not display, through and partial drills of a given size are<br>totaled together and appear in a single row. |
| Tolerance                 | Displays the tolerance of the drill size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
