**Description**

PADS DXF export attempts to preserve as much of the PADS information as possible. The translator maintains all your defined colors except the background color.

Objects are exported as follows:

- Dimension objects are exported to layers DIMENSIONx\_nn (where x is the object number, and nn is the layer of origin in the PCB design).
- General PCB information is exported as text to layer PCB\_PARAMS
- Layer information is exported as text to layer DBLAYERS (display colors, type of layer, thickness, etc.)

The *.dxf* file format is revision 12.

Exporting DXF Files

DXF Format

## DXF Import Dialog Box
To access: **Drafting Toolbar** button > **Import DXF File** button > Open a *.dxf* file

You can import specialized shapes of DXF format into your decal or into the design using the AutoCAD 2004 DXF format.

**Tip** There are two interfaces to import DXF files. This interface is optimized for importing RF shapes and only converts into 2D Lines and Copper objects. It allows you to map DXF layers to SailWind Layout layers. If you require more advanced import of any and all design objects, use the other DXF Import Dialog Box. It imports the design objects from specially named block and layers names in AutoCAD. But its mapping is hard-coded and cannot be changed.

**Restriction:**

DXF import only supports the following geometries: POINT, LINE, ARC, CIRCLE, ELLIPS, TRACE, SOLID, 3DFACE, POLYLINE, LWPOLYLINE (AutoCAD R14), and BLOCKS with hierarchy.

Assigning unique colors in AutoCAD may result in translation back to PADS as black if the color is not one of the PADS colors.

**Tip**

There are two interfaces to import DXF files. This interface is designed for advanced import of any and all design objects. It imports the design objects from specially named block and layers names in AutoCAD. This mapping is hard-coded and cannot be changed. This allows a whole design, exported from SailWind Layout, to be re-imported from AutoCAD. If you need to simply import RF shapes into the decal or into the design, use the other DXF Import Dialog Box. It allows you to map the DXF layers to SailWind Layout layers.
