## Split/Mixed Plane Layers
SailWind Layout supports the creation of split and mixed plane layers. A split plane layer is a plane layer with one or more isolated areas of copper that have different net assignments. A mixed plane layer is a plane layer with one or more copper planes and any number of signal routes.

In many designs it is common to require large copper areas for voltage and ground nets. To do this, create an internal layer dedicated to a single net (typically power or ground nets). Although it is common to have one plane layer dedicated to a single net, designs with multiple voltage requirements require you to separate, or split, the plane layer into isolated areas. When designing very dense designs, you can use split/mixed plane layers for normal signal routing.

**Setup> Layer Definition** menu item includes an option for identifying split/mixed plane layers and the 2-D drafting commands contain options for creating closed shapes to define copper planes and voids (areas with no copper). When you route on a layer identified as a split/mixed plane layer, clearances are automatically created around the trace and pin pair: the traces are actually plowed through the copper plane.

Copper plane operations also take full advantage of design rule-driven spacing and thermal relief generation. When you create copper planes with embedded traces, their spacing can be based on custom thermal clearances, design rule clearances or global clearances.

## Creation of Split Planes
You can create more than one copper plane on a split/mixed plane layer.

There are three recommended methods to split a plane layer:

- **Creating Multiple Copper Planes**  For more information, see "Creating a Copper Plane Manually"on page 667, and "Creating a Copper Plane Automatically"on page 668.
- **Separating Copper Planes Automatically**  Use the Auto Plane Separate tool to split a copper plane that covers the whole layer or a large area into two or more copper planes. For more information, see "Separating Copper Planes Automatically"on page 683.
- **Creating an Embedded Copper Plane**  Embed a copper plane within another copper plane. For more information, see "Embedded Copper Planes"on page 685.

## Separating Copper Planes Automatically
Use the **Auto Separate** button to divide a copper plane into two new copper planes. Using Auto Separate, you draw a path from one side of a copper plane to another side of the same plane. This path defines the center of the separation between the two new copper planes and divides the copper plane into two distinct shapes.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

â€¢ You must start and end the separation on the same copper plane polygon.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, in the Layer list, click the split/mixed plane layer.
- 2. Use one of the following:
	- For object mode, right-click and click the **Select Anything** popup menu item. Click the starting point of the split on a segment of the copper plane. Right-click and click **Auto Separate**.
	- For verb mode, on the Standard Toolbar, click the **Drafting Toolbar** button. On the Drafting toolbar, click the **Auto Copper Plane Separate** button. Click to indicate a starting location somewhere on the perimeter of the copper plane polygon.
- 3. Double-click at the ending point on the copper plane outline to complete the Auto Separate command.

The Assign Net to Selected Polygon dialog box displays and automatically selects one of the new copper planes. The netnames that appear in the dialog are those that were assigned to the Split/ Mixed layer in the Layers Setup.

4. From the Choose Existing Net area, click a net to assign to the selected copper plane.

This assigns the net, deselects the copper plane, and selects the other copper plane.

**Tip** No segments of the auto-separate path may be outside of the polygon or the message "All segments must be within the copper plane polygon" appears.

5. Click a net for the other copper plane. This assigns the net, deselects the copper plane and closes the dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_17_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** Use the **Tools > Options** (menu item), Copper Planes (category), Hatch and Floodon page 1511 (subcategory), Auto Separate Gap option to define the distance between the two copper planes.

6. If the message "Can't shrink polygon #1" or "Can't shrink polygon #2" appears, reduce each of the new polygons by one-half of the line width. An error occurred during this operation (probably selfintersection).

## Embedded Copper Planes
Embedded copper planes enable you to create multiple copper planes on a specific layer and control how their constructions interact with each other.

You can embed copper planes (create a copper plane within another copper plane) using one of the following methods:

Creating an Embedded Copper Plane from the Outermost to the Innermost Area Creating an Embedded Copper Plane by Prioritizing, Adding Cut Outs and Combining

### Creating an Embedded Copper Plane from the Outermost to the Innermost Area
When creating an embedded copper plane, work from the outermost area to the innermost area to ensure that all areas flood as expected.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create the outermost copper plane by drawing a copper plane as described in "Creating a Copper Plane Manually," and "Creating a Copper Plane Automatically."
- 2. Create the inner copper plane using the **Copper Plane** button on the Drafting Toolbar.
- 3. Continue nesting copper planes until you define all the embedded copper planes for the layer.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_18_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** The embedded copper planes are automatically brought to the front so they are flooded correctly. To assign different flood priorities, see the "Flood and Hatch Options Dialog Box.

### Creating an Embedded Copper Plane by Prioritizing, Adding Cut Outs and Combining
You cannot ensure correct flooding if you draw the innermost copper planes before the outermost copper planes. To ensure proper flooding of embedded copper planes, you can perform one of two methods: You can change the flooding priority of the embedded copper plane, or you can create a copper plane cut out around the perimeter of an embedded copper planes and then combine it with the outer copper plane.

**Procedure**

Choose one of the following:

- Select the embedded copper plane, right-click and click the **Bring to front** popup menu item. This sets the embedded copper plane to a lower "Flood priority", ensuring it floods before the outer copper plane.
- Alternatively, perform the following steps:
- i. Create a copper plane cut out on the outside perimeter of all embedded copper planes. (For more information, see Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out.)
- ii. Select the copper plane cut out polygon shape.
- iii. Press the Ctrl key and select the next outer copper plane.
- <span id="page-19-0"></span>iv. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item.

## Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out
A copper plane cut out is a closed, non-self-intersecting polygon that defines a void within a copper plane. Creating a cut out involves combining the copper plane shape with the copper plane cut out shape.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You can create the cut out before the copper plane or the copper plane before the cut out.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Although it appears to create a void in the edge or outline of a copper plane when in hatch outline mode, a copper plane cut out does not actually alter the copper plane outline. Create the copper plane outline as a polygon shape to create features in the outline.
- You must put the copper plane cut out on the same layer as the copper plane.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper Plane Cut Out** button.
- 2. Create one or more cut out areas for the copper plane.

See "Creating a Drafting Object" for more information.

3. Right-click and click **Select Shapes**.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** If you cannot see a cut out within the copper plane shape because the shape is flooded, type the modeless command **PO** to return the copper plane to pour outline display mode. You will need to re-flood the copper plane once you have combined the cut out with the copper plane.

4. Drag a box to group-select the copper plane and cut out(s).

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_20.jpeg)

**Note:** Some circumstances do not allow for dragging a group selection box. Instead, use Ctrl +click to select the copper plane and the cut out.

- 5. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item.
- 6. "Flood the copper plane"on page 780.

The copper plane area inside the cut out area is automatically removed. If you need to move or edit the copper plane or the cut out, be aware that any modifications you make to the copper plane shape (move, rotate, miter, and so on,) also affect the combined cut out(s). You may need to uncombine it first. For instructions, see "Uncombining Drafting Objects"on page 643.

**Results**

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_20_Picture_5.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Starting with VX.2.3, copper floods to the inner edge of completed cut out outlines instead of the centerline. Prior to VX.2.3, the cut out would grow by half the line width since copper would flood to its centerline rather than the inner edge which was the intended boundary.

As you draw the cut out shape, the drawn geometry appears in a single screen pixel line.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_20_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 88. Cut Out Outline While Drawing the Shape**

Once completed, the outline uses a real line width but is positioned completely outside the perimeter of the drawn geometry to help visualize the cut out prior to flooding.

**Figure 89. Composite of Drawn and Display Outlines**

Once the copper is poured, it pours to the perimeter of the drawn geometry - the inside edge of the cut out display outline.

## Assigning Copper Plane Thermal Attributes
A thermal setting is assigned to all pad stacks in the design automatically.

Use the Plane Thermal check box in the Pin Propertieson page 1632, Via Properties on page 1779, and Jumper Pin Propertieson page 1422 dialog boxes to determine whether the pad stack is an eligible thermal candidate. Turn the Plane Thermal check box off if you do not want any type of thermal relief on any layer of the pad stack.

For more information, see "Generating Thermals".

## Discarding Copper Plane Data on Save
If desired, you can discard copper plane data and save only the plane polygons when you save the design file.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes** (category), **Hatch and Flood**  (subcategory).
- 2. In the Save to PCB File area, select the "Copper Plane polygon outlines" option and click **OK**.
- 3. Click the **Tools > Copper Plane Manager** menu item to flood the copper planeon page 780.
- 4. Save the design.

The "Discarding Copper Plane Data Dialog Box"on page 1314 appears.

5. Click **Proceed** to save only the copper plane polygons. Click **Save All** to save all copper plane data and change the option for future saves.

## Display of Connections for Pads Connected to a Copper Plane
You can hide the connection lines (ratsnest or unroute connections) of nets assigned to a copper plane. Plane nets are typically power or ground nets; hiding them can help to clear the design space and reduce the connections to those that require more difficult routing.

Plane net connections can be made by through-hole pins connecting directly to the copper plane, or through fanout (short trace ending with a via) connections. These nets do not usually require long traces and are often not important in the strategic placement of the part - unless the copper plane to which they are attached is only in a certain area of the board. You can use the View Nets dialog box to hide the unroute connections of any or all nets in the design.

For more information, see "View Nets Dialog Box".
