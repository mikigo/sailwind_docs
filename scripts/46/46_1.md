## 3D Clearances Dialog Box
To access: Open the SailWind 3D window (**View > SailWind 3D**), then click the 3D clearances button .

Use the 3D Clearances dialog box to define additional clearances for the 3D models in your design. SailWind Layout performs a clearance check using the additional values when you click the SailWind 3D window Design Rule Check button.

## Add BGA Pin Labels Dialog Box
To access: **BGA Toolbar button > Wire Bond Diagram button >** select a BGA pin

Use the Add BGA Pin Labels dialog box to label the die part's substrate bond pad. Usually, labels match the name of the BGA pin to which they are connected.

**Description**

- You can select the pads individually, by group, or by die part.
- Selecting a die part lists all pins in the Connection multicolumn list.
- The substrate bond pad of the selected die part is highlighted in the Die Pin# column. The BGA pin labels are listed in the BGA Pad column.

Each CAM document type has a<br>specific set of options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|                       | • CAM Plane — Document CAM Plane layers. CAM planes are<br>always solid copper planes in SailWind Layout. To improve visibility<br>in the work area, CAM planes are negative images and take on the<br>background color of SailWind Layout. In the CAM Preview window<br>options, you can invert the negative image of the CAM document.<br>By default, conductive elements appear white in the CAM Preview<br>window. Layer 25 (125 in extended layer mode) is frequently used<br>for CAM plane objects where added copper is the opposite - not<br>copper (negative layer). Layer 25 can also be used for defining the<br>oversize of thermals and antipads (an old method), however, the<br>CAM Plane custom thermal setting in the Plot Options Dialog Boxis<br>a better method. Use the Select Items Dialog Boxto add layer 25 if<br>needed. |
