### Common Thermal Style Scenarios
This section discusses the three most common situations that affect thermal styles such as orthogonal, diagonal, flood over and no connect. Understanding these situations enables you to predictably create the thermal styles that you desire.

Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options

Hierarchy between Custom Thermals and Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals, Style Changes in the Thermals Options and Flood-over Vias in Copper Planes

#### Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options
There are a number of common settings for changing thermal styles in the Thermals options. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

- 1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Copper Planes** category > Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
- 2. No custom thermals are defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
- 3. The "Flood over vias" check box is unchecked (disabled) in the Flood on page 1381.

The thermal style you choose affects all component pins and all vias for all layers and for all copper planes. You can set different thermal styles for each of the four pad shapes: round, square, oval, and rectangle. You can also differentiate between through-hole and surface mount components.

**For example:** It is possible to have a through-hole round pad with orthogonal spokes and a through-hole oval pad with a flood-over. You could also set up a through-hole round pad to be diagonal while an SMD round pad is set to no-connect.

#### Hierarchy between Custom Thermals and Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options
There are a number of common settings for establishing the hierarchy between custom thermals and thermal style changes in the Thermals options. After you become familiar with them, you can determine which settings you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

- 1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Copper Planes** category > Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
- 2. You have custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
- 3. The Flood over vias check box is cleared (disabled) in the Flood and Hatch Optionson page 1381.

Settings adhere to those components with custom thermals defined. All other components and/or vias will follow the thermal styles defined in the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory. You can create a flood-over of specific pins or vias by creating a custom thermal and reducing the outer diameter size to be equal to the inner diameter size. You may find this very helpful if, for instance, you only want the two mounting hole pins of your component to flood-over when connecting to GND.

#### Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals, Style Changes in the Thermals Options and Flood-over Vias in Copper Planes
There are a number of common settings for establishing the hierarchy between custom thermals, style changes in the Thermals options and flood-over vias in the copper planes. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

- 1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes**category > Copper Planes / Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
- 2. No custom thermals are defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
- 3. The Flood over vias check box is selected (enabled) in the Flood and Hatch Optionson page 1381

Settings adhere to those components with custom thermals defined. For those vias that are within the copper plane in which you specified for "Flood Over Vias," they all flood over, no custom thermals adhere within that copper plane polygon. To set Flood Over Vias, select the copper plane in pour outline mode, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item, click on the **Flood & Hatch Options** button, and in the Flood & Hatch Options dialog box, select the "Flood over vias" check box. The thermal styles defined in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory are adhered to by all remaining components and vias.

## Generating Thermals
Component pins and vias automatically receive thermals if they are associated with a plane net and if they have pads on the associated CAM plane layer. For component pins and vias that receive thermals, the Plane Thermal option is automatically turned on in the Pin Properties dialog box.

- When you unassign a plane net from a plane layer, the thermals are removed for all of the pins in the net. The Plane Thermal option is automatically cleared in the Pin Properties dialog box.
- If during routing you add a via to a plane net, the via automatically receives a plane thermal. The Plane Thermal option is automatically selected in the Via Properties dialog box.

For information on how thermals translate to and from SPECCTRA, see the SPECCTRA Translator Help.

Check the Flood Priorities by selecting the shape, opening the Properties and clicking on the Options button. The Flood Priority numbers should be lowest for inner nested planes and greatest for the outer planes.

**Symptoms of Poor Thermal Results**

Poor thermal connectivity can cause signal integrity problems in your design.

If the following symptoms occur, see "Troubleshooting Copper Plane Fills" on page 674:

- Copper plane will not flood
- Problems with split/mixed planes

## Thermals on CAM Planes
When you generate thermals for CAM plane plots, SailWind Layout looks for plane netnames associated with CAM plane layers. SailWind Layout also checks that pins or vias with pads on the CAM plane layer have the Plane Thermal option selected in the Pin Properties and Via Properties dialog boxes. Use the "Show General Copper Plane Indicators" option in the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes**  category > **Thermals** subcategory to display CAM plane thermals.

When a pin exists in a net that is associated with a CAM plane layer and Plane Thermal is selected for the pin, a thermal appears on the pin. The ratsnest connections still appear. Use plane check in Verify Design to verify thermal generation for CAM plane plots.

**CAM Plane Thermals**

CAM plane thermals are displayed in the work area and the CAM preview area.

These calculations are also used for output during printing, pen plotting, and photo plotting operations:

- The outer diameter of the thermal matches the width of the aperture set in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box.
- The inner diameter is 75% of the outer diameter.
- The number of spokes is always four, arranged diagonally.
- The spoke width is 1/6 of the outer diameter.

**Tip** The inner width for custom CAM plane thermals is set as the pad size defined in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box. The outer width is set as the default same-net pad to corner rule.

**Viewing Plane Layer Connectivity**

For CAM plane layers, the Plane Thermal option determines whether the thermal is generated for the pin. The Plane Thermal option signals CAM output to assign a D-code for a thermal relief aperture around the pins. Set the Plane Thermal option using the Properties dialog boxes for pins, vias, and jumper pins.

If you set up a plane connection successfully, a D-Code number is assigned for a thermal relief pad in your photoplotter aperture table, one that matches each pad size required. For more information, see the Results section of "Creating a CAM Plane Gerber-format File".

## Thermals on Copper Plane Areas
SailWind Layout follows certain procedures for thermals appearing in copper planes.

SailWind Layout looks for the same net name for objects to connect with a copper plane thermal:

- A component pin receives a thermal connection to a copper plane if there is no trace connected to it and the net name of the pin matches the net name of the copper plane.
- A component pin with a trace connected to it may receive a thermal connection if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" check box is selected in the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory.
- During copper plane flooding, vias always get copper plane thermals if the netname of the via matches the netname of the surrounding copper plane, whether they show unroutes or not.

Ratsnets connections still appear after the software pours the copper plane and installs the copper plane thermals. Click the **View > Nets** menu item to open the View Nets dialog box and assign the net to the View list. In the View Details area, select the "Traces Plus the Following Unroutes" check box and set the corresponding option to "All Except Connected Plane Nets. Choose the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item to check connectivity for copper planes.

**Setting Pins and Vias as Thermals**

Jumper pins, pins, and vias can all have thermals. For these objects to be eligible for a thermal, the Plane Thermal check box in the Jumper Pin Properties, Pin Properties, and Via Properties dialog boxes must be enabled.

If you select more than one pin or via where both plane nets and non plane nets are included, and not all pins and vias are marked as eligible for indicators, the Plane Thermal check box is neither selected or cleared but shows is a solid square showing a mixed state. If you click to select Plane Thermal, the selected plane net pins or vias are updated.

**Design Rule Versus Pad Stack - Thermals and Antipads**

There are two ways to apply thermal and antipad settings. One is design-based, and uses the design rule hierarchy to apply the settings. The second is component-based, and uses the pad stacks to customize the thermals and antipads of component pins and vias. You can use a combination of design rule and pad stack thermal and antipad settings.

**Design Rule Thermals and Antipads**

Design rule thermals are defined by the settings of the Thermals Options and the Copper-to-Pad or Copper-to-Via clearance rules. In the Thermals Options you define the spokes, and using the clearance rules, you define the gap between the pad and the copper.

Design rule antipads are defined by the Pad to Copper and Via to Copper clearance rules. You can use the hierarchy of the design rules to create different gaps between the drill and copper of antipads. For example, using the Net level of the Rule hierarchy, you could apply a larger gap to any pad connected to a particular net. Antipads can be defined by the Drill to Copper clearance rule when you select the "Use design rules for thermals and antipad" check box in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory.

You can only apply separate spoke settings to drilled and non-drilled thermals. The spoke settings globally apply to all pads of either type. If you need to customize the spoke settings of individual pads, you should use the pad stack thermal and antipad settings.

**Pad Stack Thermals and Antipads**

The pad stack thermals and antipads offer full control over all aspects of thermals and antipads. Unlike the design rule thermals and antipads, you can control the spokes of individual pads.

If you apply pad stack thermals and antipads to decals in the library, those settings may not apply to different PCB designs. You may want to only apply the pad stack settings to instances of the decal in the design rather than the decal in the library.

**Priority**

Although you can use a combination of design rule and pad stack thermal and antipad settings, the pad stack settings take priority over the more global design rule settings.

## Flood Over Pads in a Copper Plane
