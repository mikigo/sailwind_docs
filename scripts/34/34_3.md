## Surrounding a Void with Vias
When you use the Via Stitch operation to place vias inside the perimeter of a shape, by default the operation does not place vias around a void within that shape. You can change the default behavior for the Via Stitch operation.

**CAUTION:**

Exit SailWind Layout before you edit the *SailWind.ini* file.

**Procedure**

1. In a text editor, open the *SailWindpcb.ini* file. The file's location is:

*C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Settings*

2. Change the VS\_StitchVoids value to 1. For example:

[ViaShield] VS\_StitchVoids=1

3. Restart SailWind Layout.

**Results**

The Via Stitch operation not only places vias inside the perimeter of a shape but also surrounds voids within the shape.
