## Routing Strategy Dialog Box
To access: **Tools > SailWind Router** menu item > **Setup** button

Use the Routing Strategy dialog box to define a strategy for autorouting your design in SailWind Router. You indicate what passes SailWind Router should perform, whether to protect the resulting traces, and what intensity to assign to objects.

| Pass Type | Lists the types of passes that SailWind Router can make. SailWind<br>Router uses the following pass types:                                          |
|           | • Center pass — Places traces equidistant from component pins or<br>vias and each other to evenly distribute any available space in the<br>channel. |
|           | • Fanout pass — Places vias for inaccessible SMD component pins<br>and routes, from the vias to the pins.                                           |

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           | • Miters pass — Converts all 90 degree route corners to diagonal<br>corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           | • Optimize pass — Analyzes each route and tries to improve the<br>quality of the route pattern by removing extra segments, reducing<br>via usage, and shortening routed trace lengths. This pass includes<br>glossing and smoothing processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           | • Patterns pass — Finds and routes groups of unrouted connections<br>that can be completed using typical "c" routing patterns, "z" routing<br>patterns, and memory patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|           | • Route pass — The core pass that performs the majority of<br>autorouting. During this pass, SailWind Router attempts to<br>sequentially route each unroute until all connections are attempted.<br>The Route pass contains serial, rip up and retry, push and shove,<br>and touch and cross processes.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           | • Test point pass — Analyzes the testability of the design,<br>determines which nets require testing, adjusts the routes, and<br>inserts test points to improve testability. You can select whether to<br>add test points during routing or after routing. See also: "Adding<br>Test Points While Interactively Routing", "Assigning Test Points<br>During Autorouting" and "Assigning Test Points After Autorouting"<br>topics in the SailWind Router Help for more information. |
|           | • Tune pass — Adjusts the length of length-controlled traces. The<br>pass examines trace lengths for only completely routed nets or pin<br>pairs. The pass analyzes the current length of each net or pin pair if<br>length rules and length control are enabled, based on the following<br>conditions:                                                                                                                                                                           |
|           | • If the cumulative length of the adjacent trace segments is within<br>the range of minimum and maximum trace length, the tune pass<br>skips the trace and does not adjust it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           | • If the trace is longer than the maximum trace length, the tune<br>pass rips it up and places it in a queue for routing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|           | • If the trace length is less than the minimum trace length, the tune<br>pass changes the length by adding accordion patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Pass      | Enables or disables the corresponding autorouting pass type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Protect   | Enables or disables the protection of traces and vias completed during<br>the corresponding pass type. Protected objects cannot be moved or<br>modified. Traces are protected and vias are glued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Pause     | Enables or disables a pause at the end of the corresponding pass type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|           | Tip<br>When you pause autorouting in SailWind Router, the pass and the<br>point within the pass are stored. When you resume autorouting,<br>SailWind Router begins where it was paused. Pause does not work<br>when routing in background mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Intensity | Sets the level of rip-up effort and number of subpasses to apply to each<br>pass. There are three intensity options:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|                    | • Low — Sets low effort, routing as quickly as possible with a low<br>completion rate, using maximum vias and trace length. Use this<br>setting when you want to complete autorouting quickly. The trade-off<br>is your completion percentage.           |
|                    | • Medium — Sets medium effort, routing more slowly with a higher<br>completion rate, using fewer vias and shorter traces. Use this<br>setting when you want to balance autorouting time and completion<br>percentage.                                    |
|                    | • High — Sets high effort, routing slowly with the highest completion<br>rate, using the fewest vias and shortest traces possible. Use this<br>setting when you want to complete all traces. Your trade-off is the<br>time required to complete routing. |
