## CAM Plus Assembly Machine Interface
The CAM Plus command generates computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) output files that are compatible with a variety of automatic assembly and pick-and-place machines. Supported formats include Dynapert, Siemens, Universal, and Quad.

Batch Mode and Masked Mode Running CAM Plus CAM Plus Report File Names

### Batch Mode and Masked Mode
CAM Plus uses the *part.def* file differently depending on whether you click Masked in the Parts list in conjunction with Batch Part Definition File.

- With Masked selected and the Batch Part Def File check box selected, CAM Plus sorts parts to all machines as defined in the *part.def*file, ignoring non-defined parts, Part D.
- With Masked selected, the Batch Part Def File check box cleared, and a specific machine selected, CAM Plus sorts only parts defined in *part.def* as assigned to that machine.
- With something other than Masked selected and the Batch Part Def File check box selected, CAM Plus sorts parts assigned in **part.def** to their respective machines, but includes undefined parts in files for all machines.
- With something other than Masked selected, the Batch Part Def File check box cleared, and a specific machine selected, CAM Plus sends all parts to the selected machine.

### Running CAM Plus
You can set up CAM Plus to generate machine-specific output files.

**Prerequisites**

You must manually create a *part.def* file in order to use the CAM Plus option. Every part that is used in the design must be listed in the *part.def* file. This may require assistance from manufacturing engineering to determine which parts to insert by which machines, and to set standard bin assignments. Also, place all design components at their final locations before you start CAM Plus. By default, the part definition file is read from the *\Libraries* folder. For more information, see Part Definition File Format.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM Plus** menu item.
- 2. In the Part Definition Filename box, type *part.def*. The file is read from the *\Libraries* folder by default.
- 3. In the Setup area:
- a. Select a side of the board from the Side list.
- b. Select the type of parts to include in the report from the Parts list.

Choose from SMT, ThruPin, All, and Masked. Masked parts are those that are assigned to the machine selected format as an insert class.

c. Select the Read Part Definition check box to add the additional information contained in the Part Definition File, *part.def*, to the parts contained in a design.

This information defines the insertion class for all parts. Read Part Definition scans the Part Definition File for information about the parts in the database. When an exact match is found between a part type name in the database and a part type name in the definition file, the information combines to provide the manufacturing output.

d. Select the Read Value Definition check box to read the Value attributes for each part in the SailWind Layout design and append the Value attribute to the part type name when matching each part type in the Part Definitions file, *part.def*.

For example, an R1/4W part type with Value attribute 100K could have an entry in the Part Definitions file as follows: R1/4W{100K},ins=un6241,bodydiam=200,leaddiam=30,anvil=2

e. Select the Verify File check box to produce an ASCII verification file.

This ASCII file is stored in the *\SailWind Projects\Cam\<board\_file\_name>* folder. This file contains 2D line data that describes the path for the inserted parts. The name of the file is the name of the interface program created, with the *.asc* extension. You can read this file into SailWind Layout with the ASCII In command. It states the insertion path as 2D lines on layer 19. If a Part\_Num value for a part is not found, Part\_Num is set to Missing.

f. Select the Batch Part Def. File check box to run all of the outputs with a single command.

For each program you run, an output file is produced with the name suffix bt or bb, for example *dym318bt.smt* or *6241bb.put*. If this file already exists, the message "Overwrite existing file (Y/N)?" appears. Click either Yes or No. If you click Yes, the file is overwritten and placed in the CAM subfolder. Each of the parts in the selected category is added to the file. A report called*insert.lst* lists each part and the machine that inserts it. The Batch command does not create a Verify file.

- 4. In the Geometry area:
	- a. Type a value for the Board Offsets to define the offset of the machine's location dowel with regard to the 0,0 system origin board.

These offset values convert the design coordinates to the machine origin. Allowable values are from 0 to 10 inches. Offset values are in inches; for example, 1250 is 1.25 inches. You may need to define a new Board offset for each machine.

b. Type values for the Step/Repeat values to define whether to treat the board as a single design when creating the output program file, or to insert a number of boards simultaneously.

When you insert a number of boards, you can define the number of steps in the X and Y direction and the step and repeat interval to use, as shown in the table below. CAM Plus uses current design units for the offset and step and repeat values. Each machine has its own units type to which the data is always converted regardless of the current design units. CAM Plus generates assembly program files for inserting parts on all boards.

| Option  | Description                                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X Count | Number of copies in X direction. The maximum is 20.                                                 |
| Y Count | Number of copies in Y direction. The maximum is 20.                                                 |
| X Step  | The step distance in the X direction between the origin of each board. The<br>maximum is 10 inches. |
| Y Step  | The step distance in the Y direction between the origin of each board. The<br>maximum is 10 inches. |

**Table 136. X and Y Step and Count Options**

The default is no step and repeat, equivalent to a step of 1 in X and Y.

5. In the Output Format list, select the machine format.

Files are produced for all parts of a selected class: masked, through hole, SMT, top, bottom, and so on. All parts in the class are included in this output file, whether or not their insert class is defined as belonging to the specific machine.

6. In the Universal Tooling and Universal Axial Output lists select the desired settings if applicable.

| Note: |
|-------|
|       |

Universal-specific instructions are available when you select Universal machine formats or check Batch Part Def. File.

**7. Click Run.**

- 8. Examine the Status Messages box for the current state of output.
- 9. Navigate to *C:\PadsProjects\CAM\Newfolder(Design Name)\* to examine the output file. CAM Plus produces and prints error messages in the file *padscim.err*.

### CAM Plus Report File Names
The file names created by CAM Plus for various insertion machines are formatted with a prefix name of the machine and a suffix of the components selected.

The prefix for each machine type is shown under the heading for each machine in the CAM Plus Supported Machine Formats. The last two characters in the output file name (shown as xx) are determined by the components selected.

Table 137shows the first letter in the pair of ending characters.

## CAM350
CAM350 is a pre-production CAM system that combines DFM analysis, DRC checking, test fixturing, planning, and tooling. The CAM350 products range from Gerber viewers to full-featured CAM editors that process PCB databases into usable fabrication and panel data.

CAM350 lets you analyze your design for manufacturing issues prior to fabrication, drastically reducing cycle time and cost. The tools are based on a fully-intelligent CAD database and can input and output virtually any Gerber format, IPC-D-350/IPC-D-356 data, CAD database, or netlist.

**CAM350 Link**

CAM350 Link is a SailWind Layout option that automatically translates a design database into a CAM350 (version 6.0 and greater) database. You no longer need to generate an ASCII file for translation; CAM350 Link uses the native SailWind Layout file format and adds a *.cam* extension. In addition to converting designs for translation, you can launch CAM350 and load the current database directly from the CAM350 dialog box.

CAM350 Link also supports backward annotation of Design For Manufacture (DFM) errors to a SailWind Layout database so that you can identify and correct DFM errors in SailWind Layout instead of making the corrections in CAM350.

See the "Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB" topic for information on outputting CAM documents from SailWind Layout. See the DFF Audit Process Flow using CAM350 Linktopic for information on CAM350 Link procedures.

**CAM350 Link Non-Supported Objects**

Some design objects are not passed from SailWind Layout to CAM350 during CAM350 Link translation when translating a CAM document with nets and when translating CAD layers to CAM layers.

These specific design objects are:

- Associated pin copper is merged into a single layer custom aperture. Associated pin copper is always merged to the pad layer during translation to CAM350. The result is that associated copper is not handled on layers other than the pad layer. In addition, associated copper is not distinguished from pad flashes.
- Combined text is not output with owning lines in CAM documents. When combined text and lines are translated to CAM350, combined text visibility is controlled by text visibility in the CAM document itself, not by the line visibility in the CAM document settings.
- The pad oversize option in the CAM documents is not supported when translating to CAM350.
- Hatched copper is not supported for PADS-format ASCII import. Hatched copper is converted to solid fill copper rather than hatched copper when translating to CAM350.
- Decal lines and text on the Top or Bottom electrical layers are not distinguished from lines and text for Top or Bottom silkscreen layers. Decal lines and text from the Top and Bottom electrical layers are moved to silkscreen layers during CAM350 translation. Visibility control for Top and Bottom lines and text can not be distinguished from visibility control for silkscreen lines and text.
- Jumper reference designators and outlines are moved to silkscreen layer. Jumper reference designators are converted to free text and jumper outlines are converted to lines in CAM350. Jumper reference designators and outlines are also moved to the silkscreen layer during translation.

The CAM350 Analysis feature reports jumpers as net connectivity errors. CAM350 does not support CAM negative planes on outer mounting layers. CAM350 does not support a layer type of negative plane for outer mounting layers.

**Test Points in CAM350**

Test points in CAM350 are used for Bed of Nails testing or Flying Probe in-circuit testing. Test points in SailWind Layout are used for in-circuit testing using fixtures. Although the test configurations and rule data are similar, there is no direct mapping between SailWind Layout test point configuration data and CAM350 configuration data.

However, test point status is passed to CAM350 for information purposes. The test point status and the access side are translated from the ASCII file to the CAM350 database.

Test point configuration data and clearance rules are not passed to CAM350 from SailWind Layout.

Probe sizes are not passed to CAM350. Only the test point location and probe side are passed.

**CAM350 Link Document Conversion**

SailWind Layout CAM documents combine layer and data type specifications for output in a CAM photoplot file. A new layer is created in the CAM350 file for each SailWind Layout CAM document.

For more information on CAM documents see the "Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB" topic.

CAM documents can be arbitrarily named. These arbitrary names are used for layer names in the CAM350 database to hold the CAM document content. The CAM350 Link extracts the SailWind Layout data types from the PADS-format ASCII file for the layers specified in the MISC CAM section of the ASCII file. The resulting layers in the CAM350 database match the content of the Gerber photoplot file generated by SailWind Layout CAM operations.

**Tip** CAM document names are truncated to 16 characters due to the maximum file name length in CAM350.

Supported CAM documents for CAM350 Link include the following five types:

- Plane: ground plane (pads, vias, copper, lines, text)
- Routing: top (pads, vias, tracks, copper, lines, text)
- Silkscreen: (outline top)
	- top: (ref. des., part type)
	- silkscreen top: (lines, text, outlines)
- Paste mask:
	- top: (pads)
	- paste mask top: (copper, lines, text)
- Solder mask:
	- top: (pads, test points)
	- solder mask top: (copper, lines, text, test points)
