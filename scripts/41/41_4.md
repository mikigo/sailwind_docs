The next time you click on the entry, the symbol preview window in the Drill Symbol Markers area reflects the symbol change.

2. To specify or change the tolerance value for a specific drill entry, double-click the target tolerance entry in the Tolerance column and type a tolerance value.

**Tip** The Tolerance column gives you the flexibility of entering a text string of up to 32 characters, which enables you to add a fabrication note along with your tolerance value. As a general rule, be careful to type suitable tolerance values. You can copy and paste tolerance data between text fields, but you cannot perform multiple cell copy functions.

## Assembly Variants
Assembly Variants allow you to create multiple versions of your assembly containing component substitutions and/or omissions. This allows one base design to support multiple product configurations at assembly time.

Substitute a Component for Assembly Variants Creation of Assembly Variants

### Substitute a Component for Assembly Variants
The Variant/Substitute dialog box appears when you choose to substitute a component in an assembly variant. When you substitute a component, the substitution is referred to as the active component. The original component that you substituted is referred to as the default. The default component is what exists in the base option and the raw database.
