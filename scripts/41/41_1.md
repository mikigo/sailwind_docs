## CAM Documents
CAM is an acronym for Computer-Aided Manufacturing. Using the CAM tools, you can produce not only Gerber-formatted photoplot or manufacturing outputs, but printouts and plots as well.

A plot type, drill, silkscreen, or routing, together with an associated output device setup is called a CAM document.

There is no default set of output configurations when you start a new design - the Define CAM Documents dialog box is empty. Different types of designs require unique sets of output files. A design with 14 layers requires a larger set of output files than a design with only 2 layers. You must define your own list of output-document configurations which you require for each design. Your configurations can be saved within the *.pcb* file, so each file has its own CAM Documents list. You can export and then import your document configurations to reuse with a similar design.

When you add a CAM document, you are adding a preset output configuration, like a script, which you run against your design to create the type of output document required. The preset (CAM document) contains the Document Type, visible objects, design positioning, and output device.

When you have a list of document configurations in the Define CAM Documents dialog box, you can quickly run the configurations against your current design and create the outputs, whether they are printouts or photo plots or both. You can print documents singly or in batch mode.

You can use Import and Export to move a CAM documents list, including the aperture list and drill feed and speed table, between *.pcb* files.

**Note:**

You can create a maximum of 250 CAM Document configurations.

## Associated Copper and CAM
CAM interprets pads and other objects differently when they are associated with copper in the PCB Decal Editor.

For more information, see Associating Copper with Terminals. Associating copper shapes and open copper is one way to create hard breakouts in decals.

- Terminals are interpreted as vias.
- Closed copper shapes are interpreted as pads.
- Open copper (a path drawn with copper) is interpreted as a trace.

## RS-274-X Format
The RS-274-X format is based on the Gerber Format Guide (Document Number: 0000-00-RM-000, Part Number: 414-100-002) by Gerber Systems Corporation. RS-274-X in SailWind Layout is a data format created in CAM for photoplotters.

Clicking the RS-274-X output format from the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Boxcreates a Gerber file with the information shown in Table 133.

<span id="page-1-2"></span>

| Field   | Description          |  |  |
|---------|----------------------|--|--|
| AM      | Aperture macro       |  |  |
| AD      | Aperture description |  |  |
| FS      | Format statement     |  |  |

**Table 133. RS-274-X Fields**

These features are allowed for the 9500, 9800, 9900, GPC, and Insight/2020 photoplotters that also support the G74, G75 multiquadrant circular interpolation function codes. Some of these parameters appear in the Gerber file depending on photo plotter settings; however, the parameters in Table 134are always present in the Gerber file.

| A format statement parameter | Describes the format options selected in the Photo Plotter<br>Advanced Setup Dialog Box, for example %FSLAX45Y45*%. |

**Table 134. Gerber File Fields**

**Aperture Table**

All simple apertures; such as round, oval, or rectangular; are described in the output Gerber file as a %ADDxx\*% parameter. The Photoplotter Aperture Report file is also created.

**Aperture Macro**

Copper areas associated with pins are output as unique aperture flashes.

Aperture support is as follows:

- Line-shaped polygonal copper with 50 vertexes or less and circular copper are supported.
- Line-shaped polygonal solid copper with 50 vertexes or less and circular solid copper are supported.
- Arc-shaped copper outlines are aperture macros in Gerber using polygonal approximation with up to 50 vertices. The %AM\*% parameter limits the number of vertices to 50.
- Thermal reliefs for CAM planes are output as macro flash.

SailWind Layout does not support copper cutouts for coppers associated with component pins.

SailWind Layout does not support hatched coppers associated with component pins. All associated coppers appear and output in CAM as solid, regardless of the grid spacing and line width.

**Fill Area**

Solid, not hatched, copper and copper planes are output in fill area mode (G36,G37 brackets). Hatched areas are output in vector format. Circular copper areas, arc-shaped polygons, and circular and polygonal copper cutouts are all supported.

**Verify Photoplots**

Verify Photoplots Document Type supports the macros, aperture selection, and fill area commands of SailWind Layout Gerber outputs. Verify Photoplots can only process RS-274-X Gerber files created by SailWind Layout.

## Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB
There are typical gerber files, drill files, assembly coordinate files, and drawings you need to manufacture your PCB. Check with your manufacturer for a specific list of requirements.

**Procedure**

- 1. Generate the outputs for the top layer:

### Creating a Custom CAM Output
You can create a custom CAM output. This setting has no presets. You start with no default assigned layers or objects and choose which items to include in the output.

**Tip** If you use the TrueLayer option, see "TrueLayer Associations" for information on how TrueLayer affects layers and CAM documents.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name.

It is beneficial to add a description of your custom output in the document name. Type a document name that describes the plot type and output device; for example, Silkscreen Top Layer - to Print. If you were outputting this document to a file, this is not the filename to which it would be saved; you define that in the Output File box in a later step.

4. In the Document Type list, click Custom.

When you select a specific document type, the program automatically generates a pre-configured set of layers and items to plot. You can use these or customize them. You can view a summary of the settings of the default document type in the Summary box. If during your selection of a Document Type you are prompted to select a Layer Association and the layer does not exist in the list, you may need to revisit your Layers Setup. Click Set Layers for a shortcut to the Layers Setup Dialog Box; otherwise you would need to close all CAM dialog boxes to access the Setup menu.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you might send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and placement in the layer stackup.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in your output and then click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output.
- 8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
- 11. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 12. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the Device Setup as needed.
- 13. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_6_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

14. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

- 15. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 16. Click **Save**.

If you close the .pcb design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer.

### Creating a Set of CAM Documents Using Auto Define
You can quickly generate a set of CAM documents for your design using Auto Define. This feature uses a predefined group of default parameters to generate a "starter" set of CAM documents that you can further refine to meet your specific design requirements.

After using Auto Define to create your baseline CAM documents, you can edit each individual CAM document configuration to change the filename and modify the design object selections to meet your manufacturing output requirements. After the edits are complete, you can save and export the configurations for use in other designs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Auto Define only creates photoplot (*.pho*) files. You must manually create any additional types of CAM documents required by your design flow for printing or pen plotting.
- Auto Define uses a generic naming convention to identify each of the different CAM document file types (solder mask, paste mask, routing/plane layers, assembly drawing, drill file, and others). You can rename the files to reflect your specific naming preferences or corporate standards.
- Auto Define analyzes the design and creates separate drill files for plated-through holes, nonplated holes, and individual partial via drill pairs (if present in the design).
- Auto Define attempts to create a complete set of CAM documents based upon your specific design setup. It does not overwrite any existing CAM document configurations that you may have already created for the design. Auto Define detects and preserves any existing CAM document configurations and only appends the remaining missing files to the design.
- You cannot modify the default parameters used to auto-generate the CAM Document configurations; however, once created, you can edit and save your modified CAM document configurations, export them, and use them in other designs.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click the **Auto Define** button.

**Results**

The newly created CAM document configurations will appear in the CAM Documents area.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_7_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:**

Auto Define always attempts to generate a full set of CAM document configurations based upon your specific design setup. If you want to use Auto Define to create a subset of the CAM document configurations, run Auto Define to create the full set of CAM document configurations and then manually delete any unwanted CAM document configurations.

### Creating a Silkscreen Gerber-format File
You create the silkscreen gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the silkscreen top or silkscreen bottom layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Silkscreen Top, or Silkscreen Bottom.

4. In the Document Type list, click Silkscreen and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *silkscreen\_top.pho* or *silkscreen\_bottom.pho*.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the silkscreen data:
	- If all your silkscreen elements have been added to the Silkscreen layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- In a typical silkscreen, you want the Component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), as well as Ref. Des., and Outlines.
	- For large components, it is common to add attributes that add dots at pin 1 and numbers around the component to lessen the time it takes to locate a pin during testing or troubleshooting. If you have added such attributes on the Silkscreen layer, you should choose to display the Attributes from the Silkscreen layer.
	- Click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output.
- 8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design line up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

<sup>11.</sup> In the Suppress area, you can suppress the display of some Reference Designators.

**Tip** For example, if you have a set of mounting holes that use the Ref Des prefix X, you can choose not to include those reference designators in the silkscreen.

- 12. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 13. In the Output Device area, click the **Photo** button if not already selected.
- 14. Click **Device Setup** and in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
- 15. Click the **Advanced** button and in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You may want to use the RS-274X format.

- 16. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box.
- 17. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Setup dialog box.
- 18. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_9_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

- 19. Repeat these steps again to create the Silkscreen output for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
- 20. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
- 21. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 22. Click **Save**.

**Tip** If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Silkscreen preview, the black lines represent the silkscreen artwork. You should typically see component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), any board identification or version text, company logo, as well as Reference Designators outside the component outlines renumbered (from the original netlist import) into an easily search-able pattern.

You can use two sets of reference designators, one set on the silkscreen layers for the silkscreen artwork positioned outside the components where they will not be hidden after the component are placed and soldered onto the board, and the other set on the assembly drawing layers centered on components for the assembly drawing. If you have not built this second assembly drawing set of reference designators into your library decals, you can quickly add them to your design. For more information, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings".

### Creating a Solder Mask Gerber-format File
You create the solder mask gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the solder mask top, or solder mask bottom layer.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_10_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Note:** Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Solder Mask Top, or Solder Mask Bottom
- 4. In the Document Type list, click Solder Mask and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_10_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in theLayers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

**Tip** An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *soldermask\_top.pho* or *soldermask\_bottom.pho*.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the solder mask data:
- You need solder mask openings for each pad of each component and (optionally) each via.
	- If you have added these openings in the pad stacks, and all your solder mask elements have been added to the Solder Mask layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- If you have not added these openings in the pad stacks, there is an easy way to get the openings that you need without editing all the pad stacks. You can add the top layer to the Selected list and select the Pads check box for that layer. This adds openings the exact size of the pads in the solder mask. You will only need to oversize the Pads in the Plot Options.
- Click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output. When looking at the preview, the white area will be the solder mask. Black areas are openings in the solder mask.
- 8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
	-

**Tip** It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design line up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

11. In the Over(Under)size Pads By box, type a value if you need to globally modify the pad size openings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_11_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** If you are using the pad shapes of an outer layer to create the solder mask openings of the solder mask layer, you will probably want to add a global oversize here.

- 12. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 13. In the Output Device area, click the **Photo** button if not already selected.
- 14. Click **Device Setup**. In the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
- 15. Click the **Advanced** button. In the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_11_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** You may want to use the RS-274X format.

16. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box.

- 17. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Setup dialog box.
- 18. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

- 19. Repeat these steps again to create the Solder Mask output for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
- 20. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
- 21. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 22. Click **Save**.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_12_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Solder Mask preview, the white area will be the solder mask. Black areas are openings in the solder mask. You should typically see solder mask openings for each pad of each component and any vias that are not tented (masked).
