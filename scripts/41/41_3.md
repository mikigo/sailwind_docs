### Creating an NC Drill File
You can create an NC drill file for each drill pair in your design. This allows the board fabricator to use separate drilling operations for specific layer pairs during the board fabrication process.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name.

It is beneficial to add not only the usage of the file in the name, but also the drill pair if using partial vias. For example, NC Drill L1-3.

- 4. In the Document Type list, click NC Drill.
- 5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and the drill pair it represents.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 7. In the NC Drill Options Dialog Box, set the options for your file.

**Tip** If you are using partial vias, you can choose which drill pair this file represents by selecting the Partial Vias check box and selecting the Drill Pair.

- 8. Click **OK** to close the NC Drill Options dialog box.
- 9. In the Output Device area with the Drill button automatically selected, click **Device Setup**.
- 10. In the NC Drill Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
- 11. Click **OK** to close the NC Drill Setup dialog box.
- 12. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

**Tip** You can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box; however, it is better instead to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box by clicking **OK** in the event you need to generate the file again.

- 13. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
- 14. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 15. Click **Save**. If you close the *.pcb* design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the NC Drill File preview, you see drill locations, but this file is not meant to be viewed like the other output files. To examine the drill symbols and their locations, view the Drill Drawingon  page 954 instead.

### Creating a Drill Drawing with Drill Table
You can create a drill drawing for one or more drill pairs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

The drill chart is only output in the drill drawing CAM document. It is not embedded in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose the **File > CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click **Drill Symbols** to open the "Global Drill Symbols dialog box"on page 1387 to define your drill symbols.
- 3. If using partial vias, select the **Unique Through/Partial column** check box to allow filtering of the drill holes.

Selecting this check box displays the Through/Partial column in the table to differentiate partial from through-hole drills.

4. If necessary, click **Regenerate** to update the table data.

Populate data in the drill drawing table by manually adding entries or by gathering information from the design database by clicking **Augment** or **Regenerate**. If you have not saved any new default settings and if no data previously existed in the table, clicking **Augment** or **Regenerate** populates the table in ascending order of size and then plated holes before non-plated holes.

- 5. Customize the settings of the Drill data as needed.
	- Customize the text size.
	- Modify the symbols used and Tolerance. For more information, see "Modifying Drill Table Entries"on page 963.
	- Sort the data in the drill drawing table by clicking the column header of drill size, quantity of the holes, or plating type. For more information, see "Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table" on  page 962.
- 6. Click **OK** to close the Global Drill Symbols dialog box.
- 7. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click **Add**.
- 8. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a name in the Document Name box.

It is beneficial to add not only the usage of the file in the name, but also the drill pair if using partial vias. For example, Drill Drawing L1-3.

9. From the Document Type dropdown list, select "Drill Drawing" and then, in the "Layer Association dialog box"on page 1437 that appears, choose one of the layers in your drill pair and click **OK**.

If you are only using through hole vias, any layer will do. If you want to display the drill holes of multiple drill pairs in the same drawing, select one of the layers in your drill pair. You will add additional layers in a later step.

10. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

(An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box but you can overwrite it.) This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and the drill pair it represents.

11. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.

12. In the "Select Items dialog box"on page 954, choose which layers to include, and check for these conditions:

**CAUTION:**

The objects that require drilling must be added to the drill drawing in order for the drill chart to be created. The chart only displays the drill data of items that are added to the drill drawing in the Select Items dialog boxon page 1699. For example, if no pads or vias are added from the electrical layers, the chart will not display drill information for those locations.

- If you have added dimensions to the Drill Drawing layer, you must enable Lines and Text.
- For designs that only use through holes, you only need to include one electrical layer. For designs that use partial vias, you need to add at least one layer that the partial via starts on, passes through, or ends on. Even though a layer of each drill pair appears in the list, you can use the Drill Drawing Options to restrict the drill holes that appear in the drawing.
- Click the **Preview** button to see what will be included in the output.
- 13. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 14. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 15. In the "Plot Options dialog box"on page 1641, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
- 16. In the Drill Chart area, type new coordinates for the Location of the chart if necessary.

In the Preview window, notice the position of the magenta-colored rectangle with respect to the position of your board outline. This is the current location of the drill chart in the drill drawing. Determine where to position the drill chart with reference to the design origin.

- 17. Click the **Drill Symbols** button and in the "Drill Symbols dialog box"on page 1334, select the "Use" check box for each drill symbol that you want to include in the drawing; then click **OK**.
- 18. Check your location of the Drill Chart in the Preview window and if needed, edit the location of the drill chart.
- 19. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 20. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the device setup as needed.
- 21. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the "Define CAM Documents dialog box"on page 1261.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_25_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** Although you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, the recommended course is to click **OK** to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in the event you need to generate the file again.

22. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

- 23. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 24. Click **Save**. If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer. In addition, the Drill Drawing preview displays drill locations with markers and a drill chart listing all the drill sizes, based on your assignments in the Global Drill Symbols dialog box and the set design unit options (mils, metric, or inches). Dimensioning measurements for the board may also display on the drawing.

### Verifying a Gerber File
Use Verify Photo to open *.pho* (gerber) files for viewing.

The Verify Photo is more than just a Preview, it looks at the actual Gerber output for its data, rather than taking data from the PCB file before the actual photoplot is generated. This allows you to create a hardcopy paper printout of your Gerber files to perform visual inspections and keep records of your plot files.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Document Type list, click Verify Photo.
- 4. In the Photo plotter output file name dialog box, browse for the gerber file.
- 5. Select the gerber file and click **Open**. The path to the file appears in the Summary area.
- 6. Click the **Preview Selections** button.
- 7. View your gerber file in the CAM Preview window.

Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB

### Creating All Outputs
You can run multiple CAM document configurations against your current design.

**Procedure**

1. Select a document configuration in the CAM Documents list.

You can also drag or Shift+click to select multiple adjacent documents. Select multiple nonadjacent documents using Ctrl+click.

2. Click **Run**.

**Results**

A prompt window verifies the list of documents to be created. The generated CAM outputs are send to print or plot or are written to a file in the CAM Directory.

When you run CAM on a layer that is specified as a mixed plane in the Layers Setup Dialog Box, the message "Split/mixed plane detected. Perform flood and DRC checks?" appears. This message appears only once when running CAM on multiple split/mixed plane layers.

- Click **Yes** to run the flood operation on the split/mixed plane, perform a Plane Check of Verify the Design, and generate split/mixed plane data for the layer. The Plane Check is run using the options of the Mixed Plane Setup Dialog Box.
- Click **No** to cancel the process. You can run Plane Check from Verify Design manually for more information on the errors.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_27_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Note:**

CAM interprets pads and other objects differently when they are associated with copper in the PCB Decal Editor. For more information, see the Pins with Associated Copper area of the "Select Items Dialog Box".

**Tip** For color print outputs, if text is combined with a 2D line or part of a dimension line, then a grayscale or preset color will be used for line items. Any free text on the board will use what is assigned for text in the Select Items dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_27_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:**

Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

## Creating Reusable Fabrication Notes
You can save your fabrications notes to the library for reuse.

**Procedure**

1. Create the individual line items of text.

For more information, see "Adding Free Text".

2. Since text alone cannot be saved to the library, add an underline to the heading of your fab notes using a 2D Line.

For more information, see "Creating a Drafting Object".

3. Combine all the text with the line item.

For more information, see "Combining Line and Text Objects".

4. Save your notes to a library.

For more information, see "Saving a Drafting Item to a Library".

## Reporting Apertures of a Photo-Plot File(s)
You can produce a report of the apertures used in a CAM Document.

**Prerequisites**

To produce an aperture report, you must have run the CAM Document(s) photo plot configuration against your design. If the CAM Document is set to print, or pen output, it will not produce the report.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. Select a CAM document in the CAM Documents list.
- 3. Click **Aperture Report**.
- 4. In the Aperture report file name dialog box, type a name for the report and then click **Save**.

**Results**

<span id="page-28-1"></span>The aperture report opens in the default text editor.

## TrueLayer Associations
By default, when you flip a component, the component attributes flip with it. For example, you flip a component from one side to the other in the design.

Although the reference designator attribute is visible and located on the top silkscreen layer, it automatically flips to the bottom silkscreen layer. You are using TrueLayer association. This feature also depends on you associating layers correctly in the Layer Setup. You can override the TrueLayer functionality by applying a command line switch to the software on startup.

<span id="page-28-2"></span>For more information, see "Software Launch Options".

## Colors in CAM Documents
You can apply colors to CAM document objects if you are outputting to a printer or a pen plotter.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

The color palette only shows colors that the printer or plotter can output. If your device can only print grayscale, the palette will show grayscale. For monochrome output devices (printers/ plotters), the only color available is black.

**Colors of Objects**

You can assign a color to the object types for printing.

• In the Select Items Dialog Box, in the Selected Color area, click a color in the palette and click the box beside a design object. You must select the check box of a design object before the object color swatch appears.

**Colors of Individual Nets**

You can use the colors you have assigned to nets in the View Nets dialog box when you print.

• In the Select Items Dialog Box, select the Color By Net check box to use the View Nets colors in the output.

## Applying the Over(Under)size Value to All Layers
You can extend the value of the Over(Under)Size value to non-electrical layers using an attribute applied to the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy.

In PADS2007.1 or later, the attribute is automatically added to all designs when opening the design or when importing an ASCII file. Opened designs, created with version PADS2007 have the attribute value set to No to only apply the Over(Under)size value to electrical layers.

Opened designs created with any other version have the attribute set to Yes to apply the Over(Under)size value to all layers.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design, select an object (for example, a component, component pad, or net), right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
- 2. In the "Attributes for" list, click PCB.

**Tip** This displays any attribute of the PCB at the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy.

- 3. The "CAM.Apply Oversize To All Pads" attribute appears in the attribute list.
- 4. Use an attribute value of Yes to apply the Over(Under)size value to all layers or use No to accept the default of applying the value only to electrical layers.

**Results**

- Is the Over(Under)size value not being applied correctly? There is a hierarchy of settings that apply to Solder Mask and Paste Mask layers, and the Over(Under)size value has the lowest priority. For more information, see "Control of Solder Mask and Paste Mask".
- Is the attribute not listed when viewing the PCB attributes at the PCB level of the hierarchy? Add the attribute with the correct value.

## Drill Drawing Options
Use the Drill Drawing Options dialog box to set drill drawing legend and marker parameters.

Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table Modifying Drill Table Entries

### Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table
You can populate and then sort the data in the drill drawing table by drill size or quantity of the holes, and then by plating type.

**Tip**

Populate data in the drill drawing table by manually adding entries or by gathering information from the design database with **Augment** or **Regenerate**. If you have not saved any new default settings and if no data previously existed in the table, **Augment** or **Regenerate** populates the table in ascending order of size and then plated holes before non-plated holes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click on the appropriate column (Size, Quantity, or Plated) in the drill drawing table.
- 2. Click another column heading (Size, Quantity, or Plated) to also sort by that column.

**Results**

The final sorting order is determined by the order in which the columns are selected for sorting.

For example, clicking the Size column first determines whether the data appears in numerical ascending or descending order. If you then click the Plated column, the list is reordered with plated or non-plated holes first while maintaining the ascending or descending numerical sorting order that you previously selected. If you then click the Quantity column, the Quantity sorting order overrides the previous selections.

**Examples**

The sorting results are formatted to correspond with the filters you have chosen.

Table 135shows the result of a sort by size (ascending order) and then by plated type.

<span id="page-31-2"></span>

| Symbol    | Size          | Quantity | Plated | Tolerance     |
|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|---------------|
