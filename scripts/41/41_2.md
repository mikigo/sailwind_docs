### Creating a Paste Mask Gerber-format File
You create the paste mask gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the paste mask top, or paste mask bottom layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Paste Mask Top, or Paste Mask Bottom

4. In the Document Type list, click Paste Mask and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in theLayers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_13_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *pastemask\_top.pho* or *pastemask\_bottom.pho*.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the paste mask data:
	- You need paste mask openings for each pad of each surface mount component.
		- If you have added these openings in the pad stacks, and all your paste mask elements have been added to the Paste Mask layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
		- If you have not added these openings in the pad stacks, there is an easy way to get the openings that you need without editing all the pad stacks. You can add the top layer to the Selected list and select the Pads check box for that layer. This adds openings the exact size of the pads in the paste mask. You can oversize or undersize the Pads (paste mask openings) in the Plot Options.
	- If all your paste mask elements have been added to the Paste Mask Top layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- Click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output. When looking at the preview, the black areas are the paste mask openings which become the solder paste locations on the board.
- 8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

**Tip** It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design line up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it s possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

11. In the Suppress area, you can suppress the paste mask openings for components.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_14_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** For example, if you have an edge connector, you do not want to add paste mask openings over its pads. If you are using the pad shapes of an outer layer to create the paste mask openings of the paste mask layer, you will want to add the reference designator of the edge connector to the Suppress box to prevent it from getting solder paste in the manufacturing process.

- 12. In the Over(Under)size Pads By box, type a value if you need to globally modify the pad size openings.
- 13. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 14. In the Output Device area, click the **Photo** button if not already selected.
- 15. Click **Device Setup** and in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
- 16. Click the **Advanced** button and in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_14_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** You may want to use the RS-274X format.

- 17. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box.
- 18. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Setup dialog box.
- 19. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_14_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

- 20. Repeat these steps again to create the Paste Mask output for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
- 21. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
- 22. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 23. Click **Save**.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Paste Mask preview keep in mind that, unlike solder mask, the paste mask is not an artwork layer - it is not a substance that is applied to the board. In this respect it is opposite to the solder mask layer. The black areas are in fact openings in the paste mask layer stencil and are the locations where the solder paste will be applied to the board. You should typically see paste mask openings (solder paste locations) for each pad of surface mounted components.

### Creating an Assembly Drawing
You create the assembly drawing for your manufacturer to reference when assembling the components on the board.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Assembly Top, or Assembly Bottom
- 4. In the Document Type list, click Assembly and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *assembly\_top.pho* or *assembly\_bottom.pho*.

6. If you need to create an assembly drawing of an assembly variant, do the following:

- a. In the Customize Document area, click **Assembly**.
- b. In the Select Assembly Variant dialog box, click the Use Assembly Variant check box to use an assembly variant as your design input for the assembly drawing.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_16_Picture_3.jpeg)

- c. In the Name list, select a variant and click **OK**.
- 7. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the Device Setup as needed.

Typically, you would send the Assembly drawings to your printer, plotter or PDF file, and not output them to a gerber file. When you activate a printer or plotter as your output, you have the option to apply different colors to items in your output document. For example, you could include traces and pads in your assembly drawing using a lighter gray color while your component outlines and reference designators remained black. This could provide more context when manually assembling the board.

- 8. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 9. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the paste mask data:
	- You can add a set of reference designators to the assembly layers, and center those reference designators inside the component outline instead of using the silkscreen reference designators which will be scattered around the outside of components. This will make the assembly drawing easier to read. For the procedures, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings."
	- You may want to add the Part Types to the assembly drawing also.
	- If you have added markers in attributes to mark pin 1, it might be beneficial to add these to your assembly drawing.
	- If all your assembly elements have been added to the assembly layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- Click the **Preview** button to check what will be included in the output.
- 10. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 11. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 12. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
- 13. In the Suppress area, you can suppress the display of some Reference Designators.

For example, if you have a set of mounting holes that use the Ref Des prefix X, you can choose not to include those reference designators in the assembly. They are not a true component and you do not need the assemblers to think it needs to be populated with a component.

14. For the assembly bottom drawing, you may want to select the Mirror Image check box to mirror the image.

- 15. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
- 16. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

- 17. Repeat these steps again to create the Assembly drawing for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
- 18. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

- 19. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
- 20. Click **Save**.

If you close the *.pcb* design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer.

When looking at the Assembly Drawing preview, you typically see component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), as well as Reference Designators centered inside the component outlines renumbered (from the original netlist import) into an easily searchable pattern.

You use two sets of reference designators, one set on the assembly drawing layers centered on components for the assembly drawing, and the other set on the silkscreen layers for the silkscreen positioned outside the components where they will not be hidden after the component placement. If you have not built this second assembly drawing set of reference designators into your library decals, you can quickly add them to your design. For more information, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings"on page 808.

### Creating a Routing/Split Plane Gerber-format File
Conductive element layers are separated into two types of outputs. Your layers are either routing/ split plane layers, or CAM plane layers. You create the routing/split plane gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the conductive layer of your PCB.

**Prerequisites**

- Before you actually create the gerber-format file for this conductive layer, you must ensure that all copper planes are flooded and filled with copper.
- Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
- 2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name.

It is beneficial to add not only the usage of the layer in the name, but also the placement of the layer in the board layer stackup. For example, Signal 2 - L6.

- 4. In the Document Type list, click Routing/Split Plane and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose your layer from the available layers.
- 5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and placement in the layer stackup.

- 6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
- 7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the silkscreen data:
	- In a typical conductive elements output, you want all the conductive elements of one layer. You probably want Pads, Traces, Vias, Copper, and associated pin copper if it exists.
	- If you add drafting elements to this layer, like lines or text, they will be manufactured as copper. You might want to move these items to the silkscreen layer.
	- Click the **Preview** button to check what will be included in the output.
- 8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
- 9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
- 10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

**Tip**

It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design lines up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

**CAUTION:** If your design has copper planes that are not filled with copper, you must fill the areas before creating the gerber-format outputs. You will be prompted to fill them in order to create the output file.

20. Click **Save**. If you close the *.pcb* design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Routing/Split Plane preview, you typically see in black - only the copper items located on the selected layer - all traces, vias, copper, copper planes. If this is a component layer, you will also see all the component pads and associated pin copper if it exists. The white areas are areas of no copper.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the CAM Plane preview, you see a negative image (opposite image) compared to the Routing/Split Plane layers. The white area is the copper and the black objects - typically only vias or through hole pin locations are areas of no copper. Since this is a negative image, you place copper on this layer to create a copper void (an area of no copper). You should see these voids if you have used them.

CAM plane thermals are displayed in the CAM Preview dialog box (and in the Layout editor). The following calculations are also used for resulting output during printing, pen plotting, and RS-274-X photoplotting operations:

- The outer diameter of the thermal matches the width of the aperture set in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box.
- The inner diameter is 75% of the outer diameter.
- The number of spokes is always four, arranged diagonally.
- The spoke width is 1/6 of the outer diameter.

**Tip** The inner width for custom CAM plane thermals is set as the pad size defined in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box. The outer width is set as the default same-net pad to corner rule.
