## Logic Families Dialog Box
To access: **File> Library** > select a Library > **Parts** button > select part > **New** or **Edit** button > **General**  tab > **Families** button

Use the Logic Families dialog box to add, delete, or edit logic family names or their reference designator prefix. Logic Families are abbreviated names for categories of parts. The abbreviated names are assigned a reference designator prefix. When creating a new part, you select a logic family to specify the reference designator prefix.

| Reuse Type | Describes the physical design reuse and its function. The reuse type<br>is similar to a library part type. Type a reuse type, up to 255 characters<br>long, for the physical design reuse. Illegal characters are slashes (\ /),<br>colon (:), asterisk (*), question mark (?), quotation marks ("), less than<br>and greater than signs (< >), and pipe ( ). You can include spaces in<br>the type, but you cannot use them as the first or last character. |
|            | The reuse type is checked to ensure it is not already in use. If it is<br>already used, an error message appears and you can specify a<br>different type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Reuse Name | Indicates a name that uniquely identifies this instance of the physical<br>design reuse. Type a name, up to 15 characters long, for the physical<br>design reuse. Illegal characters are comma (,), brackets ({ }), asterisk<br>(*), period (.), and space.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            | The default name is based on the reuse type. For example, if the reuse<br>type is Power Supply, the default reuse name is Power_Supply_1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Map Hole Features Dialog Box
To access: Select a mechanical model in the 3D Window and click the **Create Board Outline** button; then click a point on the model to use as the board origin.

Use the Map Hole Features dialog box to map holes in an imported mechanical model to hole types (such as cutouts or mounting holes) if you want to use them in your board outline. Holes from an imported mechanical model that are not mapped to a specific hole type are discarded by default.

| Inferred Hole<br>Data | Displays an identifying description of the hole; for example, "A hole of dia<br>228 (th)." SailWind Layout generates the description based on data from the<br>imported mechanical model.   |
| Hole Type             | Indicates how SailWind Layout should regard the hole. Select from the<br>dropdown list by clicking in the table cell. Available choices include "Discard,"<br>"Contour," or "MountingHole." |
|                       | SailWind Layout ignores any holes with the "Discard" selection.                                                                                                                             |
|                       | If you choose "MountingHole," you must also select a corresponding attribute<br>from the "Hole Attribute" column.                                                                           |

|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hole Attribute | Select an appropriate decal or pad stack to use for the hole by clicking in the<br>table cell and selecting from the dropdown list. SailWind Layout populates the<br>list with all mounting holes currently defined in the design. |
|                | Restriction:<br>You must have at least one mounting hole already defined for your design<br>before using this feature.                                                                                                             |
|                | The list becomes available only if you select "MountingHole" as the Hole Type.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Highlight      | Select the check box if you want SailWind Layout to highlight the associated<br>hole in the 3D Window.                                                                                                                             |
|                | Highlighting the hole provides a means of quickly locating it.                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Manage Library Attributes Dialog Box
To access: **File> Library** > **Attr Manager** button

Use the Manage Library Attributes dialog box to manage attributes on a library-by-library basis. You can add, delete, and rename attributes for all parts or decals in an individual library or in all libraries. You can also display all the attributes in a library, whether the attributes apply to all items or to individual items.
