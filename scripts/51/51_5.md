## Net Properties Dialog Box - Design Reuse
To access: Select a reuse with nets > right-click > **Properties** popup menu item > **Net Properties** button

Use the Net Properties dialog box to resolve netname conflicts between netnames in a physical design reuse and netnames in the design.

**Restriction:**

You cannot rename and merge a net. For example, if you have GND in the physical design reuse and GND1 in the design, there is no available method to rename GND to GND1 and then merge. You must add GND and then manually merge the nets using ECO.

**Description**

Only netnames from route and polygon elements in the physical design reuse appear in this dialog box. Net properties are applied to route and polygon elements. For example, assigning a merge status for net GND merges all physical design reuse net and polygon objects using net GND with net GND in the design.

| Rename in Design (Private) | Lists nets in the physical design reuse to rename in the design. Nets<br>are renamed using the Rename Preferences settings.                                                                                                                                                           |
|                            | If nets exist that should remain intact, and not be merged with nets in<br>the design, place them in this list. These nets are called private nets<br>because they are internal to the reuse and are not connected to other<br>nets in the design, nor do they have the same netname. |
|                            | If you want the net to be merged with a net in the design, move it to the<br>Add/Merge in Design (Public) list.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Add/Merge in Design (Public) | Lists nets in the physical design reuse to either add to the design<br>(because the net does not exist in the design) or to merge with a net in<br>the design (because the net does exist in the design). These nets are<br>called public nets because they are used in both the physical design<br>reuse and the design.<br>If you want the net to remain separate from the net in the design, move<br>it to the Rename in Design list. |
| Net Append Options           | Indicates whether to rename a net using a prefix or a suffix. Affixes<br>(prefixes and suffixes) can be up to four characters long. Illegal<br>characters are brackets ({ }), asterisk (*), space, and period (.). You<br>can, however, leave the box empty, and that is considered a valid<br>entry.                                                                                                                                    |
|                              | The value you type here is checked against the design to ensure<br>that duplicate netnames are not created. If duplicates occur, an error<br>message appears and you can specify a different affix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                              | Tip<br>If you are not in ECO mode when you access this dialog box from<br>the Reuse Properties Dialog Box, the Net Append Options are<br>unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Arrow Buttons                | Move selected nets between the list boxes. Click the >>> button<br>to move selected nets in the Rename in Design (Private) list into<br>the Add/Merge in Design (Public) list. Click the <<< button to move<br>selected nets in the Add/Merge in Design (Public) list into the Rename<br>in Design (Private) list. This is useful if you specifically want a net to<br>remain separate from a net that exists in the design.             |
|                              | When you access this dialog box from the Reuse Properties Dialog<br>Box, these buttons are unavailable. This prevents you from modifying<br>physical design reuse nets. You can however, change the suffix and<br>prefix for netnames if you are in ECO mode.                                                                                                                                                                            |

Non-shape pins are<br>pins for which the design contains no pin definition, or for which the<br>pin definition has zero shape or a very small shape of one or two basic<br>units (one basic unit = 1/400,000 MM).                                           |

Since hole sizes are<br>finished size with plating, the drill oversize value is required to verify against<br>design rules to ensure that the larger holes drilled during manufacture are not<br>going to cause problems. Clearance, and Latium Design Verification checking<br>use the value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|                      | CAUTION:<br>The Drill oversize value does not apply to the Drill Drawing table, or NC<br>Drill outputs - those values are finished hole sizes. The value affects copper<br>plane flooding clearances, based on the drill-to-copper clearance and its<br>CAM output (if the "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" setting is<br>enabled in the Copper Planes category > Thermals subcategory). Your<br>PCB fabricator normally oversizes plated holes to match the drill size that<br>you specify in the pad stacks (finished hole size). Your PCB fabricator may<br>also increase the apertures of antipads in pour areas using pre-production<br>software and you may need to disable the drill oversize value after you have<br>verified your design is production ready and you are ready to create your<br>gerber files. |
|                      | Tip<br>The oversize is measured from the center of the pad, not the perimeter. For<br>example, a 3 mil oversize represents 1.5 mils in all directions from the center<br>of the pad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
