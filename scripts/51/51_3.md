## Manage Mappings Dialog Box
To access: Open the 3D view (**View > SailWind 3D**), then click the **Manage Mappings** button .

![](/layout/guide/51/_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

Use this dialog box to reassign or reuse 3D models for parts on the rendered PCB design. For example, if you want to assign an SOIC 3D model to other SOIC devices on the PCB that appear physically identical, you can use this dialog box to make the assignment to the other devices.

**Restriction:**

You cannot reassign a 3D model to a part if the part is already saved in the library with a 3D model.

|                      | Part Number — Displays the number of the part associated with<br>the model. You can only assign one model to a part; therefore,<br>part numbers appear only once in the list.                                                                               |  |  |  |

|                      | Mapping — Indicates whether the model assignment is mapped<br>locally or in the part library. You can change model assignments<br>for a part locally; however, if the part is saved with a model in the<br>library, you cannot change the model assignment. |  |  |  |
| Parts without model  | Lists information about all of the parts that are not mapped to<br>3D models. Parts not mapped to 3D models are represented by<br>either 2D or 2.5D (extruded) models instead.                                                                              |  |  |  |

## Markups Dialog Box
To access: **Edit> Markups** menu item

Use the Markups dialog box to view or log issues concerning the design. You can add 2D line markups to issues, to outline or highlight their location. You can also link design objects to markups. Then you can export the issues alone or export the design and any issues for viewing and logging additional information in visECAD.

## Matching Result Dialog Box
To access:

- On the Design Toolbar click the Make Like Reuse button, and then select a reuse type/file in the "Select Reuse Module" dialog box.
- Select a Reuse in the design, and then right-click and click the **Make Like Reuse** popup menu item, or on the Design Toolbar click the Make Like Reuse button.

Use this dialog box to see whether a match to the selected reuse is found in the design. If yes, you can make a new physical reuse design with it; if not, you can view the matching report in detail.

To access: Open the SailWind 3D window (**View > SailWind 3D**), then click the **MCAD Collaborator**  button .

Use this dialog box to exchange mechanical design change information between the PCB design team and the mechanical design team. This dialog box allows you to create and annotate change proposals in a *.idx*, .*idxz*, or *.xml* file, which you can then exchange with mechanical designers.
