# Chapter 22 SailWind 3D
As an alternative to standard two dimensional board layout, SailWind Layout provides a three dimensional, graphical representation of your project in the SailWind 3D window. In addition to allowing interactive component placement, the SailWind 3D window also renders your board layout in a realistic three dimensional view, thereby letting you preview your design, perform physical measurements from one component to the next, and check clearances with imported mechanical designs, such as mounting brackets.

## SailWind 3D Overview
The SailWind 3D window provides a three-dimensional rendering of your PCB layout, including electronic components and mechanical assemblies (such as mounting brackets or connectors). This threedimensional representation allows you to examine the PCB construction, move and align components,

and check clearances between components on your PCB and adjacent assemblies (such as EMI shields, heat sinks, and covers). The SailWind 3D window also provides tools for aiding in the design collaboration process with mechanical (MCAD) designers.

**Part Placement in SailWind 3D**

One of the primary purposes of the SailWind 3D window is to allow you to view a three-dimensional representation of your design to check clearances between components and surrounding assemblies or mechanical parts in the X, Y, and Z direction.

However, if desired, you can synchronize the SailWind 3D window with the two-dimensional layout design view, meaning selecting and moving a part in one view updates the part's position in the other view. This synchronization feature becomes helpful if you choose to place parts in your PCB design using the SailWind 3D window instead of the standard two-dimensional layout design view.

Using the SailWind 3D window, you can assign or "map" 3D models to your parts, thereby giving them an accurate three-dimensional representation (see Assigning a 3D Model to a Component). You then have the option of saving the 3D model mapping for re-use with other designs by saving it to the Reuse folder

location for a netlist project — see 3D Model Mapping. Alternatively, you can keep it mapped to part in the PCB design only.

For 3D model alignment, the SailWind 3D window appears adjacent to the Decal Editor along with the Align 3D Models dialog box (see Align 3D Models Dialog Box). The Align 3D Models dialog box provides you with the ability to align the pads of a 3D model with the pads of a part decal, as displayed in the SailWind 3D window.

**Clearance Checking Features**

For checking clearances, the SailWind 3D window provides options:

- Manually check distances between a component and a point on the PCB or an assembly using the "Measure Distance" and "Measure Minimum Distance" features. This option is especially useful when aligning a 3D model with decal pads.
- Perform automatic design rule checking across the entire design through the use of 3D clearances Design Rule Checks (DRC).

**Note:**

Use the 3D Clearances dialog in the SailWind 3D window for defining your 3D clearances.

**MCAD Collaboration**

To aid in the collaboration effort with mechanical designers, the SailWind 3D window features the MCAD Collaborator, a tool for tracking and annotating design change proposals. With the MCAD Collaborator, you can establish an initial or "baseline" design with the mechanical designers. When you make a change from the baseline layout design (for instance, you move a part), the MCAD Collaborator lists the affected part as a change proposal and allows you to exchange the proposal with the mechanical design team as an *.idx* file. Upon acceptance from the mechanical designers, the proposal becomes the new baseline.

## SailWind 3D Object Manipulation
You can rotate the viewing angle of your PCB design in the SailWind 3D window along three axes. You can also zoom in or out to change the magnification of the rendered PCB design. Use the viewing controls in tandem with the SailWind 3D window display options to view various features of your PCB design.

**Rotating the View**

Choose the **View > SailWind 3D** menu item to open the SailWind 3D window. The window displays next to the SailWind Layout design window.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 39. The SailWind 3D Window**

You can resize the SailWind 3D window as necessary by dragging its border with the mouse.

The SailWind 3D window features a 3D view "cube" control for rotating, zooming, and panning the threedimensional PCB. Rotate the PCB in the SailWind 3D window to a fixed or orthogonal view (such as front view, top view, left-hand view, and so forth) by either clicking a corresponding surface of the cube, or by clicking a rotational arrow to rotate the PCB view in 90° increments.

**Note:** Clicking a cube surface also changes the view to the default magnification.

Click the "home" icon at the corner of the cube for an isometric view of the PCB.

Alternatively, you can rotate the PCB dynamically by clicking any surface of the cube control and rotating it in the desired direction. The PCB moves as you rotate the cube.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 40. Rotating the PCB with the 3D View Control**

**Zooming and Panning**

Use the 3D view control to zoom in on the PCB or pan across to view certain details as described in the following table:

| If you want to                      | Do the following                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom in or out of the current view. | Press the Ctrl key and drag the 3D view controller<br>up or down.        |
| Pan across the current view.        | Press the Shift key and drag the 3D view controller<br>in any direction. |

**Using the Middle Mouse Button**

Alternatively, if you want to rotate the board along a single axis or manipulate the 3D view from anywhere on the display using the middle mouse button, do so as follows:

| If you want to                      | Do the following                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom in or out of the current view. | Press the Ctrl key and rotate the middle mouse<br>wheel up or down. |

**Table 103. Manipulations with the Middle Mouse Button(continued)**

The SailWind 3D window supports most zooming functions available in the 2D workspace. For more information, see Zooming Overview.

**Tip** Rotation with this method is limited to one axis at a time. To rotate the PCB in a dynamic direction, use the 3D view control instead.

**Preset Views**

The SailWind 3D window provides preset views (View Top, View Bottom, View Front, View Back, View Left, and View Right) for rapid access to standard views. Access these preset views by clicking the

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_5_Figure_8.jpeg)

associated buttons in the 3D window toolbar.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>While these preset views do not adjust the image magnification, they are useful for returning the view to an established angle, such as the top or front view.

## 3D Model Mapping
The SailWind 3D window allows you to assign a 3D model to a PCB component and align it with the decal pads. This alignment and assignment information is known as model *mapping*.

Mapping 3D models begins with assigning a 3D model to a component in the SailWind 3D window—see Assigning a 3D Model to a Component. After assigning and aligning the 3D model, you have the option of saving the mapping information to the Reuses folder location (for a netlist project).

When you map a 3D model to a component, and you choose to save the model mapping to the *Reuse*  folder location (using the Update Library Dialog Box), SailWind Layout associates the 3D model assignment with the part type. It also associates the 3D model alignment information to the decal.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

The mapping function allows you to re-use the 3D model with any other design that has the same part type and decal combination. For more information, see Reusing 3D Models with Other Components in a Design.

Update Library Dialog Box

## Assigning a 3D Model to a Component
Assign or "map" 3D models to component decals and align them so the SailWind 3D window accurately represents them in the rendered image. Import a new 3D model from an external source and map it to a decal then align the 3D model so that it is placed correctly on the PCB.

You can map 3D models in one of two ways: directly within the 3D window or within the Decal Editor.

Within the 3D window:

- You can perform mapping more quickly than editing in the Decal Editor and reloading the design in the 3D window after returning
- Changes do not modify the decal
- Changes apply to all components with the same part type-decal pairing
- You can make alignment changes in delta offset values only

Within the Decal Editor:

- You can apply a model mapping to multiple Part Types
- Changes modify the decal, possibly making it appear in the list in the Update from Library Dialog Box
- You can make alignment changes in absolute or delta offset values
- When exiting, you can choose to apply mapping to the selected component or to all components using the same part type-decal pairing

**Procedure**

1. Select a component in the SailWind 3D window.

If you select an ECO-registered component, ensure the it meets "certain requirements"on  page 531 so that it displays correctly in the SailWind 3D window.

2. Click the **Import Part Model** button on the 3D window toolbar. .

Alternatively, if you want to use the Decal Editor, perform the following steps:

<span id="page-7-0"></span>a. Right-click on a component and click the **Edit decal** popup menu item.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_7_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

If your software license does not enable this feature, click in the standard twodimensional layout design view to access the **Edit decal** command.

The Decal Editor opens and displays the default two-dimensional decal of the component and a corresponding representation in the SailWind 3D window adjacent to it. The Align 3D Models Dialog Boxalso opens.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

- b. In the Align 3D Models dialog box, select the part name (or names, if you want to map the same 3D model to more than one part) in the "Parts mapped to selected model" list and click **Import**.
- 3. In the Import Part Model dialog box, select the correct model definition file you want to import and click **Import**.

If you are assigning a 3D model through the Decal Editor, the new model appears in the Model Name list of the Align 3D Models dialog box as the model mapped to the decal.

- <span id="page-8-0"></span>4. Rotate or reposition the imported 3D model as necessary so it aligns correctly with the decal pads as follows:
	- a. Rotate the model so it is oriented correctly over the pads (its pins do not need to be aligned yet —you will align them in the next sub-step).
	- b. Click the **Align Pin-Pad Center** button. The decal pads hide temporarily to simplify alignment.
	- c. Select a face on a model pin to use for alignment, adjusting the 3D view as necessary for access. For example, if you are aligning a SO-14 package, select the bottom surface of pin 1 that you expect to make contact with the pad.

The decal pads return to view after you select an alignment face.

- d. Click the corresponding decal pad to which you want to align the center of the selected pin face. The model moves so the center of the pin face is aligned with the center of the pad.
- e. In some cases—such as when you are mapping a through-hole component—you may also need to define which model face you want to make "seat" against the pad.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 42. Selecting a Model Face**

- i. Click **Define Seating Plane**.
- ii. Rotate the 3D view as required to access the model face you want to seat against the pad.
- iii. Click the face to select it. The model adjusts to seat the face against the pad.

**Note:**

If you close the 3D Window before exiting the Decal Editor, the Decal Editor prompts you to save your data. Click **Yes** at the prompt to save the 3D model mapping and apply the 3D model to all parts in the design that have the decal. Otherwise, click **No** to abandon your changes.

5. Click **OK** when finished aligning and centering the model with the decal pads.

In the 3D window, you can save changes to the library using the Update Library Dialog Box. You can also use the Manage Mappings Dialog Boxto apply mappings to other components in the design.

After updating the library with your changes, you can later "change the 3D model"on page 532 associated with the component but you can no longer delete all model associations.

6. (Decal Editor only) Choose the **File> Exit Decal Editor** menu item when you are finished aligning the imported model.

In the Apply Decal Changes prompt, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design or **Selected** to apply the model to the selected component only.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** Click **All** if you change only the model alignment.

**Results**

The SailWind 3D window displays changes in the three-dimensional representation of your design and its components.

Saving 3D Models for Re-use in Other Designs

## Reusing 3D Models with Other Components in a Design
As a time-saving measure, you can reuse or reassign 3D models to components on the rendered PCB design that share a common physical footprint. For example, you can assign the 3D model from a surface mount resistor to a surface mount capacitor if the two components appear physically identical.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot use the Manage Mappings dialog box to reassign a 3D model to a part if the part is already saved in the library with a 3D model.

**Prerequisites**

You have already mapped the 3D model you want to reuse to at least one component.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **Manage Mappings** button.
- 2. Select the "Enable cross probing" check box in the Manage Mappings Dialog Box.
- 3. Click a component in the 3D window that has the 3D model you want to reuse and make note of the corresponding entry indicated in the "Parts mapped to models list" of the Manage Mappings dialog box.

## Holes in SailWind 3D
In some cases, you must add certain attributes to components if you want the holes to display properly in SailWind 3D.

Holes Displayed in the 3D Window Assigning a 3D Model to a Non-ECO Mounting Hole Rendering Mounting Holes on ECO-Registered Parts as Voids Setting Multi-Pin Components to Display Holes for Some Pins

### Holes Displayed in the 3D Window
Pin holes, mounting holes, and other component holes do not always render as voids in SailWind 3D. The display of holes depends on several factors, such as whether or not the component is an ECOregistered part or a non-ECO registered part, the number of pins, and whether or not it has a pin with a drill specification.

Generally, the pin holes of a component (such as a through-hole capacitor) always appear filled in SailWind 3D. For all other components, you must assign either the "HOLE" attribute or the "MountingHolePins" attribute for holes to display as voids.

The following sections summarize how holes render in SailWind 3D under various conditions.

**ECO-Registered Parts**

- Pin holes display as filled by default, even for through-hole components and components with only a single pin.
- Components with multiple pins that have mounting holes still render as filled.
- You can make the voids visible in SailWind 3D by applying either the ""HOLE" attribute"on page 531 or the ""MountingHolePins" attribute"on page 532.

**Non-ECO Registered Parts**

- Pin holes display as filled by default UNLESS the component has a single pin with a non-zero drill specification, in which case it converts automatically into a mounting hole and displays as such.
- SailWind 3D automatically renders a non-ECO component with a single pin as a mounting hole if the pin has a non-zero drill specification. This automatic rendering prevents you from selecting the mounting hole in the 3D window (to assign a 3D model to it, for example).

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_12_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:** A mounting hole generally displays as a hole in the board, nothing else.

• You can assign a 3D model, such as a standoff, to a non-ECO component if you first "apply the MountingHolePins attribute"on page 530. Assigning this attribute enables you to select the

component in the 3D window. Assigning the attribute also effectively converts the component from a mounting hole to a mechanical component with one mounting hole inside it.

**Note:**

SailWind 3D renders any non-ECO registered part with the "MountingHolePins" attribute as a mechanical component if the part has only a single pin (such as is the case for a mounting hole or fiducial). Be aware that turning off the display of mechanical models in the SailWind 3D settings hides such parts. Also be aware that these parts export as mechanical parts when exporting the design to MCAD software.
