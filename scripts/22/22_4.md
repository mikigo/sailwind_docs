## Exporting the 3D Image to a Graphics File Type
Capture the current SailWind 3D window and export it as an graphics image file for use in assembly drawings and other manufacturing or test documentation.

**Procedure**

1. In the Display Control dialog box, use the display options in the Components area of the to highlight specific parts or toggle their visibility if necessary.

**Note:**

You can also choose to export the design as a PDF or image file but your export options are limited in such a case.

**Tip** Use the 3D rotate, pan, and zoom controls to orient the design in the SailWind 3D window the way you want it to appear in the exported image.

- 2. On the 3D General Toolbar, click the **Export** button.
- 3. In the Export dialog box, choose the directory path, type the file name, and in the "Type" dropdown list, choose SAT (*.sat*) or STEP (*.step*) as the file type.
- 4. In the "Mechanical Model Options" area, determine the type of design objects you want to export by selecting either "All mechanical models" (any mechanical models you have added plus the board with the components) or "Include with board export items only" (just the models with the "Include with board export" check box selected in the Properties dialog box).
- 5. Select the check box for each element type you want to export.
	- The Silkscreen and Soldermask check boxes apply to STEP file export only.
	- You can choose to export element types in separate files by selecting the "Export as Sheets" check box. For more information, see Export Dialog Box.
- 6. Click **Save**.

**Results**

SailWind Layout saves the specified mechanical models as one or more files, depending on your export selections. Note that if you export certain mechanical model elements as individual sheets (files), and

later you clear one or more of the element type check boxes in the Export dialog box, SailWind Layout deletes the corresponding SAT or STEP file.
