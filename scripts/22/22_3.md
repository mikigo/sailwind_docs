## Component Placement in the SailWind 3D Window
As an additional tool for PCB layout, you can use the SailWind 3D window for component placement. Using the SailWind 3D window allows you to check the component placement in three dimensions.

After you import a design, SailWind Layout initially places all the design components on the PCB origin. With the SailWind 3D window, you can disperse the components and place them around the PCB as you would in the standard two-dimensional design view. The SailWind 3D window supports many of the standard component placement functions through use of a context menu.

For example, you can spin, rotate, nudge, disperse, and move components to the PCB flip side from withing the SailWind 3D window by right-clicking on a component and selecting an option from the popup menu. For more information about component placement, see "Part Placement"on page 471.

**Restriction:**

Use the standard two-dimensional design view to route and connect your components; the SailWind 3D window does not support component routing.

As with the two-dimensional design view, you can use on-line Design Rule Checking (DRC) to alert you to clearance warnings or violations while placing components in the SailWind 3D window. See "Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D" on page 545 for instructions.

## Synchronizing the Design and SailWind 3D Viewing Areas
Set options to enable the views in the Design space and the SailWind 3D window to mirror one another in zoom level and pan area.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window with nothing selected, right-click and click the **3D Display Control**  popup menu item, or on the 3D General toolbar, click the **3D Display Control** button.
- 2. In the "3D Display Control Window"on page 1034, in the Options section:
	- Select the Drive 2D View check box to send synchronization commands to the Design view. Zoom levels and pan moves made in SailWind 3D will be matched in the Design space.
	- Select the Follow 2D View check box to receive synchronization commands from the Design view. Zoom levels and pan moves made in the Design space will be matched in SailWind 3D.
- 3. Click **OK**.

## Defining 3D Clearance Constraints
Define 3D clearance X,Y, and Z axis constraints for the objects in SailWind 3D. You can define generic, mechanical model type, and component specific constraints.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• 3D clearance constraints affect only models in SailWind 3D and do not conflict with or override design constraints.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, on the 3D General toolbar, click the **Clearances** button .
- 
- 2. In the 3D Clearances Dialog Box, to add a new row, click the **Add** button .
- 3. In the new row, click the From and To fields to choose objects from the lists.
- 4. Type values where needed in the Minimum XY, Minimum Z, Optimal XY, and Optimal Z boxes. If there are blank values the clearance is not checked. For example, this allows you to omit the XY clearance for a connector sticking out past the board edge. Specify a blank XY value for the specific component to board edge constraint.
- 5. Repeat as necessary.
- 6. Click **OK**.
- 7. For the next step, see either "Running Batch 3D Clearance Checking"on page 546 to check all design objects or "Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D" on page 545 to view clearance violations as you move objects.

## Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D
Enabling standard on-line Design Rule Checking (DRC) in the **Tools > Options** menu also allows you to view 3D clearance violations in the SailWind 3D window while you position components on the PCB.

You can define your 3D clearances using the 3D Clearances Dialog Box.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

DRC in the SailWind 3D window checks only the 3D clearances; they do not conflict with or override design constraints.

**Prerequisites**

You have already defined one or more 3D clearances for your project (see "Defining 3D Clearance Constraints"on page 544).

**Procedure**

- 1. Enable on-line DRC in either the "Prevent Errors" or "Warn Errors" mode—see "Design Rule Checking"on page 410.
- 2. Position your PCB components as required. While positioning your a component, the component changes color (you may have to hold to component with the cursor at a position and allow it to "hover" a moment) to indicate 3D clearance violations as follows:
- **Optimal XY or Optimal Z violations**  Affected components or surfaces highlight in yellow when placement exceeds any "optimal" clearance.
- **Minimum XY or Minimum Z violations**  Affected components or surfaces highlight in red when placement exceeds any minimum clearance.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_29_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 50. 3D Optimal and Minimum Violation Examples**

3. Reposition the affected component as required until the highlight disappears, indicating the 3D clearance is no longer exceeded.

## Running Batch 3D Clearance Checking
Check all 3D objects against the 3D Clearances constraints.

**Prerequisites**

• 3D Clearances must be defined. For more information, see "Defining 3D Clearance Constraints"  on page 544.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, on the 3D General toolbar, click the **3D Design Rule Check** button

. A Processing dialog box opens displaying the elapsed time for the process. Then a window opens displaying the number of hazards found and showing a path to the log file.

2. In the Output Window, click the link to view the contents of the log file.

## Changing the Appearance of Components and Models in 3D
You can alter the appearance of components and assemblies in the SailWind 3D window to make it quicker to identify key groups or components. For example, you can color code all 3D models of high frequency parts to make grouping them easier prior to routing. You can also make components transparent to view details beneath them.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the 3D Display Control Window.
- 2. Select a component or mechanical model using one of the following methods:
	- Click on a component or mechanical model on the PCB in the SailWind 3D window; then in the appropriate Components, Assemblies, Mechanicals, or PCBs area of the 3D Display Control dialog, click **Add selected** to add it to the list.
	- If the component does not appear in the list, click **Add** and select it.
- 3. Locate the component in the appropriate list (Assemblies, Components, Mechanicals, or PCBs) of the 3D Display Control dialog box and select its corresponding Appearance checkbox. Ensure the Appearance check box is selected for the component or assembly and make the following changes are desired:
	- Assign a color from the Color palette and set the transparency to the desired level.
	- Clear the corresponding Visibility check box to hide a component or assembly.
- 4. Click **Apply** after making your changes.
- <span id="page-30-1"></span>5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box when you are done.

## Measuring In 3D with Measure Distance

3D Display Control Window

## Viewing Internal Layers in SailWind 3D
The SailWind 3D window provides a virtual preview of the final manufactured PCB, allowing you to see into the layer stackup and inspect internal routing, via connections, and other design factors not visible in the 2D view.

Use the SailWind 3D window to analyze how blind and buried vias are connected through the layer stackup on a routed design. By scaling the design and zooming into areas of dense routing, you can verify that via connections on internal layers meet design specifications. Manipulating or rotating the design in the SailWind 3D window may also help you identify regions in high density designs where you can improve the placement or routing (see "SailWind 3D Object Manipulation"on page 519).

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, open the 3D Display Control Window.
- 2. Select the "Include Internal Layers" check box to view the traces and pads on the internal layers.

3. In the Options section, select the "Z-Axis Scaling" check box and choose a value for the Scale Factor from the dropdown list. (The larger the scaling value, the wider or "thicker" the gap between layers becomes in the Z-

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_35_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** Selecting the Z-Axis Scaling check box also displays via barrels in the inner layers that are not otherwise visible when selecting the "Include Internal Layers" check box alone.

- 4. Use the 3D view controls to orient the design in the SailWind 3D window and focus on a specific area you want to analyze.
- 5. Visually examine the critical traces and vias to determine if the inner layer structures meet the design requirements. Note that the SailWind 3D window measuring tools (Measure Distance and Measure Minimum Distance) continue to report true material measurements regardless of z-axis scaling.

If necessary, you can select the Copper Planes check box (in the Objects area) to view internal layer copper planes. Ensure you click **Refresh** after selecting the Copper Planes check box to ensure the copper planes are visible.

## Creating 3D Cross Sections
Create cross-sectional "cutaway" views in the SailWind 3D window to view details such as the fit between the PCB components and mechanical assemblies or enclosures.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_36_Figure_2.jpeg)

Creating a cross sectional view allows you to access components, vias, traces, and other details hidden by enclosures or other objects.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **X Cut Plane**, **Y Cut Plane**, or **Z Cut Plane** button, depending upon which direction you want to "cut."

You can click one, two, or all three cut plane buttons and have more than one active cut plane at one time (though only one cut per plane type).

2. When the cut plane appears, drag the cut plane to the location where you want it and rotate it as necessary to achieve the desired cutaway view. The 3D cut plane removes all 3D material to one

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_37_Figure_2.jpeg)

side from view.

3. Click the cut plane button again to remove the cut plane.

The cut plane returns to its original pre-defined starting location the next time you click its corresponding button.

## Checking the Status of the 3D Design
As you make changes in the SailWind 3D window, you may lose track of the parameters you have set and how the design is currently configured. You can generate a report of the 3D statistics and verify that the 3D design is acceptable.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Design Status** button on the 3D General Toolbar.

A 3D Design Status Report file appears.

2. Review the contents of the report file to verify the 3D parameters.

| Status Parameter | Description                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design Z Extents | Shows the maximum range in the Z-axis of all models in<br>the design. |

| Status Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        | Note:<br>The beginning value of the range shows a negative<br>number if models are mounted on the rear of the<br>PCB.                                                              |
|                        | The Design Z Extents range tells you the overall<br>thickness so you can verify that you have not exceeded<br>the overall thickness (height) restriction for the<br>assembled PCB. |
| Parts Models Found     | Lists the 3D model assignments for each part in the<br>design.                                                                                                                     |
|                        | Review this list to verify that you have the correct model<br>assignment for each part.                                                                                            |
| Parts Models Not Found | Lists all parts that do not have a 3D model assignment.<br>By default, these parts are represented by 2D extruded<br>models.                                                       |
|                        | To assure the greatest accuracy possible in the 3D View,<br>assign 3D models to all of the parts in this list when<br>possible.                                                    |
| Assemblies             | Lists the mechanical assemblies that you have imported<br>into the design.                                                                                                         |
|                        | Review this list to verify that you have imported all of the<br>correct assemblies in the design.                                                                                  |

3. (Optional) Make any changes necessary. For example, change model assignments, assign 3D models to parts that do not have model assignments, or change the Z-axis clearances to accommodate height restrictions for the design. After making the changes, generate a new 3D Design Status Report and review it again.
