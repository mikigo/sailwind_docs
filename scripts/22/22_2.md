### Assigning a 3D Model to a Non-ECO Mounting Hole
In some cases, you may want to assign a 3D model, such as a standoff, to one or more board mounting holes. You can assign a 3D model after first applying the "MountingHolePins" attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the 2D workspace, right-click the mounting hole then click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
- 2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, select the component level from the "Attributes for" list.
- 3. Click **Add**.
- 4. In the new Attribute box, type, "MountingHolePins" and press the Enter key.
- 5. (Optional) If you want the hole to continue to display as a void, type the pin number in the Value box.
- 6. Close the Object Attributes dialog box.
- 7. In the 3D window, select the corresponding mounting hole (note that it now displays as filled unless you specified the pin number in the Value box). Apply and "assign a new part model"on page 523.

### Rendering Mounting Holes on ECO-Registered Parts as Voids
In some cases, ECO-registered parts may not appear correctly in the SailWind 3D window; specifically, if a part is a single pin part, you must add certain attributes to the part decal to ensure a correct appearance.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click the component in either the 2D workspace or the 3D window, then click the **Attribute**  popup menu item.
- 2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, click **Add**.
- 3. Type one of the following attributes:

| Pin Type     | Attribute |
|--------------|-----------|
| Through-hole | HOLE      |
| SMD          | FIDUCIAL  |

**Table 104. Required Attributes**

For a single-pin, through-hole part, adding the "HOLE" attribute displays the hole as a void in the SailWind 3D window. For SMD single-pin parts, add the "FIDUCIAL" attribute in cases where you want the part treated as a fiducial.

**Figure 45. ECO-Registered Mounting Hole Before and After Applying the HOLE Attribute**

### Setting Multi-Pin Components to Display Holes for Some Pins
You can set attributes on an ECO-registered part so that the holes associated with one or more selected pins render in SailWind 3D as voids.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click the component in either the 2D workspace or the 3D window, then click the **Attribute**  popup menu item.
- 2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, click **Add**.
- 3. Type "MountingHolePins" as the new attribute name and press the Enter key. In the Value box, type the pin number for each pin in the component where you want the corresponding hole to display as a void. Ensure you separate each pin number with either a comma or a space (for example, "P001,P003,P005," and so on).

**Note:** Keep the following in mind

- Ensure you specify the pin number of the part, NOT the decal pin number
- If you specify all pin numbers for an ECO-registered part, SailWind 3D renders the part as a mechanical model. Be aware that these parts export as mechanical parts when exporting the design to MCAD software.
- The software takes longer to render the 3D image of your PCB the more pin numbers you specify for hole rendering.

## Changing a 3D Model Assignment
You can change or assign a different 3D model to a component decal.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Mapping through the Decal Editor allows you to choose to apply changes to only a component instance, if desired. Mapping in the 3D window applies changes to all instances of a component.
- If you have already updated the library with a 3D model assignment, you can change the assigned 3D model but you cannot remove all 3D model associations from the component.
- Be aware that any mapping changes made in the Decal Editor—including assignment and alignment of 3D models—affect the decal timestamp, which may affect the schematic during backward annotation.
- In the 3D window, you can use the Manage Mappings Dialog Boxto apply mappings to other components in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the part to which you want to assign a different 3D model.
- 2. Click the **Import Part Model** button on the 3D window toolbar. .

Alternatively, if you want to use the Decal Editor, perform the following steps:

a. Right-click on a component and click the **Edit decal** popup menu item.

The Decal Editor opens and displays the component decal and its currently mapped 3D model.

- b. In the Align 3D Models Dialog Box, select the part or parts in the "Parts mapped to selected model list" that you want to reassign then click **Import**.
- 3. In the Import Part Model dialog box, browse to and select the correct model definition file you want to import and click **Import**.

If a dialog box appears with a caution about rewriting a file, click **Yes** to overwrite the model currently in the local design library, **No** to import the file as a new model, or **Cancel** to exit without making changes.

- 4. "Rotate or reposition"on page 525 the imported 3D model as necessary so it aligns correctly with the decal pads; then click **OK**.
- 5. (Decal Editor only) Choose the **File> Exit Decal Editor** menu item when you are finished aligning the imported model.

In the Apply Decal Changes prompt, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design or **Selected** to apply the model to the selected part only.

The new 3D model appears in the Model Name list of the Align 3D models dialog box as the model mapped to the decal.

- 6. In the "Apply Decal Changes" dialog box, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design.
- 7. If you previously saved the model mapping to the Reuses file location, you can update the mapping:
- a. Click the **Update Library** button in the SailWind 3D window toolbar.
- b. In the Update Library Dialog Box, select the check box of the part with the new mapping.
- c. In the Overwrite policy list, choose "Overwrite all in Library."

## Importing and Aligning 3D Mechanical Models
Add mechanical designs such as mounting brackets to your PCB design in the SailWind 3D window to examine clearances and construction with the rest of the PCB. Adding 3D mechanical designs helps to ensure the PCB parts fit with the mounting hardware or enclosures in the final, packaged PCB assembly.

You can import mechanical designs in a wide variety of file formats, including *.asat*, *.iges*, *.sat*, *.step* (*.stp*), and *.xtda*.

**Prerequisites**

• You have opened a design in SailWind Layout and you have also opened the SailWind 3D window.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **Mechanical Model Properties** button .
- 2. In the Mechanical Model Properties Dialog Box, click the **Add** button ; then browse to and select the mechanical model file and click **Open**.

**Tip** You can also import a mechanical model from the SailWind 3D window by clicking the

**Import Mechanical Model** button .You can then modify its properties by selecting the model and clicking the **Mechanical Model Properties** button.

The imported mechanical model appears in the SailWind 3D window and a temporary instance name appears in the **Instance** dropdown list.

- 3. Rename the mechanical model by typing a more descriptive name in the **Instance** dropdown list.
- 4. Select a model type to determine which 3D clearance rules to apply and where to display the model in the 3D Display Control settings (see 3D Display Control Window).
- 5. Rotate and align the 3D mechanical model to its proper position in relation to the PCB design using the Rotate and Offset controls. Alternatively, select the Allow interactive mechanical model movement check box to reposition the mechanical model by dragging it with the mouse. Rotate the PCB angle as required to align the mechanical model in the X, Y, and Z direction. See SailWind 3D  Object Manipulation.
- 6. Select or clear the check boxes for your save options.
- 7. Close the dialog box and save the PCB design when you are through adding the mechanical model.

**Results**

You have added and aligned a mechanical model to your 3D PCB layout. If necessary, you can use the commands on the mating toolbar to ensure an accurate fit between mechanical models. For more information, see Positioning 3D Mechanical Models Using Mating Commands.

## Positioning 3D Mechanical Models Using Mating Commands
You can use the mating commands (on the 3D window Toolbar) to accurately mate the surface of an imported 3D mechanical model with another surface. Two mated surfaces connect physically and remain in contact. Attempts to manipulate movement of one mated model is thus limited to permit only movement that keeps the mated surfaces in contact.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:**

The mating commands apply to mechanical models only. To move or manipulate components, use the Decal Editor.

**Prerequisites**

You have already imported a 3D mechanical model and rotated or aligned it roughly in the position where you want to place it.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, click to choose the mechanical model that you want to mate.
- 2. On the 3D window toolbar, click the **Mate Selected Models** button.
- 3. On the mechanical model, click the surface, edge, or other feature (such as a hole) that you want to mate to another surface.

To aid in choosing the feature, right-click and click a popup menu item to limit feature selection to the type of feature you want to align:

- **Snap to Closest**  Enables you to click any mechanical feature of the model, whether it is an axis, edge, or face.
- **Snap to Axes**  Enables you to click the discernible X, Y, or Z axis of a feature on the model, such as a hole, cutout, or corner.
- **Snap to Edges**  Enables you to click any edge of the mechanical model.
- **Snap to Faces**  Enables you to click one of the non-edge surfaces of the mechanical model.

SailWind Layout highlights the chosen feature after you click it.

4. Click a corresponding surface or mechanical feature on the other model where you want the mechanical model to mate. For example, if you choose a standoff on the mechanical model, and you want to mate it to a mounting hole on the PCB, click the desired mounting hole on the PCB.

The mechanical model moves or snaps to the selected mechanical feature. In addition, in the Mechanical Model Properties Dialog Box, the alignment and movement features become disabled. SailWind Layout permits only movements that allow the two mated surfaces to remain in contact.

5. To disassociate or "unmate" the two surfaces at any time, click the mechanical model again to choose it and click the **UnMate selected models** button.

If you want to unmate all models at one time (without having to choose them all first), click the **UnMate all models** button.

## Creating a Board Outline From an Imported Mechanical Model
You can import a mechanical model into the SailWind 3D window for use as a physical board outline in your design. If you want to use any of the holes already in the mechanical model, you must map them to their proper type, such as cutouts or mounting holes, to ensure proper import.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_19_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Note:**

If you re-create a board outline using the same mechanical model, SailWind Layout discards your previous hole mappings.

**Prerequisites**

You have imported the mechanical model that you want to use for your board outline.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window toolbar, click the **Create Board Outline** button.
- 2. Select the surface of the imported mechanical model that you want to use for the board outline.
- 3. Click the location on the mechanical model that you want to use as the origin of the board outline.
- 4. A list of holes already in the imported mechanical model appears in the Map Hole Features Dialog Box. Select each hole that you want to use for the board by clicking the Hole Type box and choosing the corresponding hole type from the dropdown list:
	- <Discard> The default setting. The software ignores holes set to "Discard" when it generates the board outline.
	- Contour Indicates the hole is a cutout.
	- MountingHole Indicates the hole as a board mounting hole. Choose this option only if you want to map a hole in the mechanical model to an existing hole in your PCB design. If you choose this hole type, click the Hole Attribute box and select the corresponding mounting hole attribute from the dropdown list.

You can clear the Highlight check box for each hole individually to make identification easier. The SailWind 3D window centers a hole on the display if you select its check box again. Alternatively, you can click any hole on the mechanical assembly to cross probe with the holes in the dialog box. 5. Click **OK**. The Map Hole Features dialog box closes and the design updates with the new board outline.

The updated board outline appears in both the SailWind 3D window and the layout design view.

## Creation of 2.5D Models
SailWind Layout creates a "2.5D" model automatically by combining a component's outline (such as that used for silkscreen) with its Geometry.Height attribute. When you open the SailWind 3D window, any part that does not already have a 3D model assigned is represented by a 2.5D outline. The component outline must meet certain requirements to ensure proper generation of the 2.5D model.

**Component Outline Hierarchy**

SailWind Layout locates component outlines using a layer hierarchy:

- 1. Layer defined in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file
- 2. Layer 25 (125)
- 3. Top associated assembly layer
- 4. Top layer
- 5. <All Layers>
- 6. Layer 20 (120)

To define a component outline layer in the SailWindpcb.ini file, open the file (at *<drive>\<install\_folder> \<release>\Settings\SailWindpcb.ini*) with a text editor and add the following line:

3D\_Shape\_Layer = <layer number>

Where <layer number> is the component outline layer.

**Component Outline Requirements**

Component outlines must be closed in order for SailWind Layout to generate a 2.5D model. If you place any open component outlines on a layer defined in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file, for example, SailWind Layout disregards the open outlines and selects only those that are closed.

To ensure SailWind Layout generates 2.5D models for all components, create closed component outlines and place them on Layer 25. SailWind Layout locates the closed component outlines as it searches through the component outline hierarchy. For example, if you have open silkscreen outlines for a component on the top layer—and the top layer is defined as the component outline layer in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file—ensure you add corresponding closed outlines of the component to Layer 25.

Compare 3D and 2.5D Models

## Compare 3D and 2.5D Models
As an additional aid for laying out parts on your PCB, you can view the "2.5D" models in tandem with 3D parts in the SailWind 3D window. Enabling the 2.5D view allows you to check the alignment and positioning of a 3D model in relation to the original 2D layout to verify you have mapped the correct model.

The "2.5D" model is an extrusion of the decal's silkscreen outline and the Geometry.Height attribute. When you open the SailWind 3D window, any part that does not already have a 3D model assigned is represented by a 2.5D outline of its decal. Any 3D model you assign to a part replaces the 2.5D model.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 48. A 2.5D Model Replaced by a 3D Model**

As a layout verification, you can turn on the 2.5D model after assigning a 3D model by selecting the Overlay 3D Models with 2.5D check box in the 3D Display Control Window. The correctly aligned 3D model overlays the 2.5D outline.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

Reposition or realign the 3D model as necessary to reconcile any significant placement differences between the 2.5D and 3D models. If the models are not the same shape, ensure you have mapped the correct 3D model to the part.

See "Comparing 2D Components with 3D Models"on page 541 for instructions.

- problems.
- 2. Examine the design and identify any components that may have alignment or positioning

**Tip** To better evaluate the alignments, rotate the 3D image or change the view settings as needed. If necessary, clear the Perspective check box in the 3D Display Control dialog box so you can see the alignments and positions more clearly.

3. Correct any problems by adjusting the alignment of the 3D models so they are positioned correctly relative to the 2D components and land patterns.

## Saving 3D Models for Re-use in Other Designs
You can save 3D ("map") model-to-decal alignments from one PCB design and re-use them in an existing design wherever the part types and decal names are the same. For example, if you have two PCB designs that share a specific IC with an SO-16 decal, mapping a 3D model to the IC in one PCB design allows you to use the same 3D model with the IC/decal combination in the other PCB design. SailWind

Layout saves your 3D model mappings to the Reuses file location specified in the **Tools > Options> Global> File Locations** tab.

**Prerequisites**

- You are viewing a PCB design in the SailWind 3D window.
- You have mapped at least one 3D model to a decal in the PCB design.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the Update Library button.
- 2. In the Update Library Dialog Box, select the 3D model mappings that you want to save. Mappings are listed in the dialog box according to the part and decals to which they are mapped.

Select the Enable cross probing check box if you want the ability to click on a part in the design to interactively locate its corresponding mapping in the list.

- 3. Select an overwrite policy from the Overwrite policy list.
- 4. Click **Apply** to save the 3D model mapping or mappings to the Reuse file location.
- 5. Click **OK** to close the message prompt.
- 6. Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

**Results**

You have mapped 3D models to part types in the Reuse file location and you have saved the 3D model alignment information with the part decals. The 3D models automatically appear in other designs wherever the part and decal combination is the same. If changes occur to any of the mapped 3D models externally to the PCB design, you can import the changes by clicking the **Update Models** button in the

SailWind 3D window.
