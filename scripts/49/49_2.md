## Error Detected Dialog Box
To access: This dialog box is inaccessible unless the software crashes and crash detection is enabled in the software *.ini* file.

The Crash Detected dialog box opens at a crash and allows you to save a report of the SailWind environment as well as pertinent files into a compressed Dump File. You can then submit this file to SailWind Software Customer Support. You can attach feedback to this report, and optionally, the BMW media and project files.

| Comments box              | You can describe what you were doing when the error occurred<br>or anything else you can think of that might help when<br>investigating the crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |
| Attach BMW data check box | You can include BMW data and your project files. This will allow<br>customer support to play back what you were doing in your<br>design that led up to the crash. This check box is unavailable if<br>the BMW feature is not enabled.<br>See also: "BMW and BLT".                                                                                                                 |  |
| Save button               | You must click the Save button if you want to create a report file.<br>When you click the Save button, you are prompted with a Save<br>As dialog box. The file that is created is called a PADS Dump<br>File and is compressed in the .zip format. This is the file that<br>you must send to customer support. It will include the report, the<br>BMW data and the project files. |  |

|                             | • Metal: Internal — Data on any internal copper layers will be<br>exported. This option needs to be selected if you want the pads<br>on internal layers. Copper on internal layers is generally only<br>consumed by tools like Simcenter Flotherm XT where they want to<br>do a thermal analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |  |
|                             | • Via Holes — Outputs the via holes in the board STEP file with the<br>option to include the blind via holes too. Holes take a lot of time to<br>process. If there are many blind via holes you can save a lot of time<br>by not exporting them. If you export Soldermask it will cover up the<br>via holes unless you have a Soldermask pad on the Soldermask<br>layer which is not usually the case for vias.                                                                                                               |  |  |
|                             | • Export as sheets — If selected, exports copper data as an infinitely<br>thin sheet without any thickness. Depending upon the use-case,<br>this may be fine for the target system. If cleared, the copper<br>data is output with the same thickness as seen in the 3D view.<br>The advantage of using this option is that you can typically see<br>a reduction in file size and a reduction in load time in the target<br>system. If you simply want this data for visualization purposes then<br>consider using this option |  |  |
|                             | • All Nets/Selected Nets — Of the object types selected to export<br>(pads, planes, traces), select all nets to export all those objects or<br>limit the objects by choosing nets in the Select Nets Dialog Box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |  |

Fabrication Checking

## Fanout Rules Dialog Box
To access:

• **Setup> Design Rules** menu item > **Default** button > **Fanout** button

Use the Fanout Rules dialog box to specify fanout rules. Use fanouts to make routing easier and to ensure that connections are made. SailWind Router optimally places fanout vias and routes from vias to corresponding pins for ordered components or separate pins. Fanouts are most useful for some complex SMDs, like BGAs.

**Tip** While you can define these rules in either SailWind Layout or SailWind Router, the rules are used only in SailWind Router.

![](/layout/guide/49/_page_24_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

In SailWind Layout, you can define fanout rules for only SOIC/QUAD type components. Use SailWind Router to also define fanout rules for BGA and staggered BGA fanout patterns.

|               | • 1 Trace — Width of one trace. This sets a via grid that enables SailWind<br>Router to route one wire between adjacent vias.                                                            |
|               | • 2 Trace — Width of two traces. This sets a via grid that enables SailWind<br>Router to route two wires between adjacent vias.                                                          |

|               | • Through pins — Connect to a through pin if the cost is lower than the cost to<br>use a via.                                                                                            |
|               | • SMD pins — Connect to an SMDon page 1860 pin if the cost is lower than<br>the cost to use a via. If this is disabled, SailWind Router routes each SMD pad<br>directly to a pin or via. |
|               | • Vias — Connect to a shared via. If this is disabled, SailWind Router creates<br>unique vias for each surface-mount pad.                                                                |

|               | • Plane — Create fanouts for pins belonging to plane netson page 1849.                                                                                                                   |
|               | • Signal — Create fanouts for pins belonging to signal nets.                                                                                                                             |

| Preview       | Shows the fanout layout based on your selections.                                                                                            |
| Delete button | Removes non-default fanout rules at the current level of the rules hierarchy.<br>Restriction:<br>You cannot delete the Default fanout rules. |

**Tip**

Fanning out an entire design is not generally recommended because it creates many vias. However on component-dense PCBs requiring many layers, it may be necessary to fan out all SMD components.

## Find Dialog Box
To access: **Edit> Find** menu item

Use Find to locate and select single or multiple objects by reference designator, part type, line width, or other attributes.

**Description**

Find works two ways, depending on your selection modeon page 115:

- **Select mode**  Find ignores the Selection Filteron page 114 settings and selects whatever you ask it to.
- **Verb mode** Find only looks for items that are logical for verb mode.
