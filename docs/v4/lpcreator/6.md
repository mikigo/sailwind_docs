**<span id="page-0-0"></span>Hole Size Calculator**

The Hole Size Calculator provides a quick and easy way to determine the size of a hole based on what goes into it.

**Figure 17. Hole Size Calculator**

Type options include wire, screw or user defined.

- **Wire Gauge** the **Size** list is populated with a variety of standard AWG wire sizes.
- **ANSI Screw**  the **Size** list is populated with a variety of standard ANSI screw sizes.
- **Metric Screw**  the **Size** list is populated with a variety of standard Metric screw sizes.
- **User**  a diameter size can be entered by typing in a value for a single size. A square or rectangular size can be specified by typing in two values (the first for the length, the second for the width) separated by a comma.

The hole size is calculated using one of six Fit options.

- **Exact**  the hole will fit the target size without any clearance.
- **IPC Most**  the hole will fit the target size using IPC fabrication level A.
- **IPC Nominal**  the hole will fit the target size using IPC fabrication level B.
- **IPC Least**  the hole will fit the target size using IPC fabrication level C.
- **ANSI Tight** the hole will fit the target size using the standard for an ANSI Tight clearance.
- **ANSI Loose**  the hole will fit the target size using the standard for an ANSI Loose clearance.

The calculated **Hole Diameter** is displayed. When used in conjunction with a land pattern calculator that allows a hole size to be specified (Shrouded Header Hole Size (d) for example) this value can be dragged and dropped in the Calculator.

The Hole Pad Stack Calculator provides a quick and easy way to determine the various elements for a hole and each layer element.

**Figure 18. Hole Pad Stack Calculator**

This calculator is similar to the Hole Size Calculator to the extent that the hole size can be calculated based on the size and shape of the object the that hole will accommodate and the fabrication level of the application. Additionally the hole size can be directly specified.

Sizes for All pad layers, anti pad and thermal relief are calculated, displayed and may be copied into other applications.

**<span id="page-2-0"></span>Via Calculator**

Choosing the right via for a particular application takes a number of considerations into account: The desired design via spacing grid; the trace and space widths; the number of traces required to pass between vias; the thickness of the material; the amount of power the via may be required to carry.

The Via Calculator is designed to accept a few of the foregoing as user inputs and generate the remaining as outputs as well as calculating the proper Padstack for the resulting via.

**Inputs to the BGA Via Calculator**

- **Pitch** (center-to-center spacing of BGA pads).
- **Pad (Diameter)**
- **Minimum Pad-to-Via Spacing —** A typical default value for this entry is automatically applied based on the BGA Pitch/Pad combination. BGA calculations are automatically transferred to the Application Calculator where additional configurations may be tried.

**Inputs to the Application Calculator**

Calculations made to the BGA via calculator will be transferred to the application calculator but changes made to the application calculator do not effect the BGA calculator.

- **Number of Traces between Vias**
- **Trace Width**
- **Space Width**
- **Via Grid** (center-to-center spacing of vias).

**Outputs from the Via Calculator**

• **Aspect Ratio** (material thickness divided by hole diameter) — is the relationship between the hole and the thickness of the material the hole will penetrate. This is important because affects the ability to properly plate the barrel of the via in the board fabrication process. The aspect ratio is calculated by dividing the material thickness by the hole diameter.

When any via calculation is initiated the aspect ratio is calculated to a value of 7:1. Ratios greater than this value should be avoided. Changing the thickness recalculates the aspect ratio without effecting the Via Pad stack

• **Current Capacity** (approximate) — is the maximum amount of current that may be applied to the number of "Vias req'd". When any calculation is initiated the power capacity is recalculated for a single via. Changing the Current recalculates the number of required vias without effecting the Via Pad stack.

This value is based the premise that each hole will be plated with a minimum copper thickness of 1 mil. The calculator then converts the cross section of the plated area of the hole to an equivalent wire and applies the standard formula *I = k \* (T ^.44) \* (A ^ .725)* where I = current in Amps, k = debating constant 0.024 for inner layers and T = temperature rise in C, 10 being typical.

- **Padstack information** the correct via for most applications may be found by changing the inputs and evaluating the outputs. Then use the Padstack information to define the via in the design database.
	- **Finished Hole**  This will be the diameter of the finished hole after plating the barrel to .054 mm (1mil) of copper.
	- **Pad**  This is the pad diameter for all routing layers.
	- **Antipad**  This is the hole clearance diameter for unconnected plane layers.
	- **Thermal ID/OD**  If you choose not to "flood over" vias ID will be the inner diameter and OD will be the outer diameter of plane thermal voids.
	- **Spoke Width** This the width of 1 (of four) of the conductive elements spanning the ThermalID/OD void.
	- **Solder Mask**  For finished holes of .4mm or larger , a Solder mask equaling the hole diameter + .15mm is added the via.
	- **Via Padstack Name** This name is based on the hole and pad size.

**Via Viewer**

The Via Viewer displays the Via Hole (Black), Pad, (Blue), Antipad (Gray), and Traces (Blue) in there true proportional size. Thermals are not shown.

When an "Antipad Encroaches on Trace" message is generated the location of the problem is indicated by a White circle at the encroachment location.

When the Via BGA calculator is used as the source of the calculation BGA pads are represented by six (Gray, partial) circles in their true proportion to the vias.

**<span id="page-4-0"></span>Calculating Vias**

Depending upon factors such as the routing density and minimum clearance rules, via calculations can sometimes be complex. Use the Via Calculator dialog box to calculate vias.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the main toolbar, click the **Calculate** button then click Via Calculator.
- 2. In the "Via [Calculator" on page 95](#page-2-0), if the application is for a BGA use the BGA calculator first to select an appropriate via for the BGA.
- 3. Adjust Number of Traces, Trace and Space Widths, and Grid to the design constraints then click on the **Calculate** button to calculate and display the results.
- 4. Use the Statistical entries to gather information about the calculated via and use the Padstack data to create the padstack in your design database.
