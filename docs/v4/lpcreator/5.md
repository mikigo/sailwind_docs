# Chapter 5 Land Pattern WizardThe land pattern wizard is used to generate the land patterns for your CAD tool. Choose a particular component type, enter component dimensions, specify the rules file you would like to use and a customized land pattern is generated that is ready to use in your CAD tool.

Preferences are unique for each CAD tool and displayed according to the selected Librarian CAD tool. Generally, these preferences will include, where required or supported by the individual tool:

- An output directory
- An output software version
- Available user defined options
- Layer definitions

**Table 11. Preferences Dialog Box, SailWind Layout Output Content**

**<span id="page-4-0"></span>SailWind Layout Part Type and Decal Names**

Normally, Part Type and Decal names assume the same name as the generated land pattern. User defined names may be substituted.

Use the following method: Create two new SailWind library attributes, "PartType" and "Decal", and Include them in the CAD output (See Help topic "Wizard, Options Page"on page 54). Before creating the land pattern from the Wizard, fill in the names to use for the Part Type and Decal and select the 'Include in CAD output' check box. When this method is used, if neither the user-defined Part Type name or Decal name is the same as the land pattern name, a new Part Type attribute for 'Land Pattern Name' is automatically added as a reference to the original name.

Once the options have been set, click the **Create** or **Create and Close** button to begin the translation process.

**Tip** SailWind Layout output is generated in Millimeters and Mils units only.

**<span id="page-4-1"></span>Importing Files into SailWind Layout**

There are 3 methods to import files into a SailWind Layout library. The software creates Part Type (.p) and Decal (.d) files that can be imported from the SailWind Layout design space, imported using the SailWind Library Manager, or automatically using a direct interface to SailWind Layout.

When translation is complete, the SailWind library is created if it doesn't exist, and the new parts added.

**Choose one of the following:**

- [Importing into a SailWind Layout Library Automatically](#page-5-0) If you have both SailWind Land Pattern Creator and SailWind Layout on your computer, this method is automatic and the easiest.
- [Importing Manually Using the SailWind Library Manager](#page-7-0) If you don't have both SailWind Land Pattern Creator and SailWind Layout on your computer, this method can be used to create SailWind *.p* & *.d* files for import into a library using the SailWind Library Manager.
- [Importing to a SailWind Library Using an ASCII File into a Design](#page-8-0) If you don't have both SailWind Land Pattern Creator and SailWind Layout on your computer, this method can be used to create a SailWind ASCII file for import into a blank design where you can save the part types and decals from the design area into the library.

**<span id="page-5-0"></span>Importing into a SailWind Layout Library Automatically**

Transfer Calculator land pattern data automatically into a SailWind library name of your choice.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• The included extended library files; *PCBM-STARTER.plb09*, *SM\_MFR.plb09*, *CONNECTORS.plb09* and *TH.plb09* include special user defined attributes. In order to include all these attributes in your SailWind Land Patterns they must be defined in SailWind using the Attribute Dictionary or you will receive expected Warnings. If you do not wish to import these attributes you can simply ignore the Warnings. You should review the supplied \*plb09 file attributes included to determine their desired use.

**Prerequisites**

- A session of SailWind needs to be open in order for the data to be automatically passed into the SailWind library.
- Ensure that neither the Part Type or Decal editors are open.
- Do not attempt automatic import when multiple sessions of the SailWind software are running.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose one of the following:
	- Use the single part wizard within the Calculator:
		- i. On the toolbar, click **Wizard**.
	- Use the multi-part wizard within the Library Editor:
- i. Open SailWind Land Pattern Creatorand use the **Library** > **Editor** command to choose the library (*\*.plb09*) file that contains the Land Pattern you want to create.
- ii. Use the gray box to the left of the Land Pattern name to select Land Patterns.
- iii. Next either right-click and click the **Tool > Wizard** popup menu item or click from the menu bar to launch the "Multi-Part Wizard Dialog Box"on page 76.
- iv. Provide the desired settings and click **Continue** to launch the Wizard.
- 2. In the CAD Tool list, select **SailWind Layout**.
- 3. Match the SailWind output Version to your opened SailWind Layout version.

|  | CAUTION: |  |
|--|----------|--|
|  |          |  |

Importing incompatible versions can result in library corruption. A warning message appears if the files are not compatible with the running SailWind software version.

- 4. In the Auto-import area, select both Part Type and Decal check boxes.
- 5. Provide the library directory and library name as required.
- 6. Click either **Create** or **Create and Close**.

When complete, a prompt will display saved-to information:

7. In SailWind Layout, open the Library Manager and select the created library in the Library list - (added to end of the list by default).

**<span id="page-7-0"></span>Importing Manually Using the SailWind Library Manager**

Create SailWind .p & .d files and import them into a library using the SailWind Library Manager. This option does not require a session of SailWind to generate the SailWind CAD Output.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• The included extended library files; PCBM-STARTER.plb09, SM\_MFR.plb09, CONNECTORS.plb09 and TH.plb09 include special user defined attributes. In order to include all these attributes in your SailWind Land Patterns they must be defined in SailWind using the Attribute Dictionary or you will receive expected Warnings. If you do not wish to import these attributes you can simply ignore the Warnings. You should review the supplied \*plb09 file attributes included to determine their desired use.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose one of the following:
	- Use the single part wizard within the Calculator:
		- i. On the toolbar, click **Wizard**.
	- Use the multi-part wizard within the Library Editor:
- i. Open SailWind Land Pattern Creatorand use the **Library> Editor** command to choose the library (\*.plb09) file that contains the Land Pattern you want to create.
- ii. Use the gray box to the left of the Land Pattern name to select Land Patterns.
- iii. Next, either right-click and click the **Tools > Wizard** popup menu item or click from the menu bar to launch the "Multi-Part Wizard Dialog Box"on page 76.
- iv. Provide the desired settings and click **Continue** to launch the Wizard.
- 2. In the CAD Tool list, select **SailWind Layout**.
- 3. Match the SailWind output Version to your opened SailWind Layout version.

**CAUTION:**

Importing incompatible versions can result in library corruption. A warning message appears if the files are not compatible with the running SailWind software version.

- 4. In the Auto-import area, clear both the Part Type and Decal check boxes.
- 5. Provide the desired library directory location for saving the .p & .d files.
- 6. Click either **Create** or **Create and Close**.
- 7. Read the Caution prompt and continue as desired.
- 8. You can do either of the following:
	- Navigate to the supplied Library directory to retrieve the .p & .d. files
	- Import .p & .d files into SailWind by opening the SailWind Library Manager, selecting Decals and importing the .d file and selecting Parts and importing the .p file.

**<span id="page-8-0"></span>Importing to a SailWind Library Using an ASCII File into a Design**

Create a SailWind ASCII file, import the ASCII data into a blank design and save the part types and decals from the design area into the library.

You can use SailWind ASCII for Single Part or Multi-Part Cad Output. When using SailWind ASCII Cad Output, a *\*.asc* (ASCII) file is always created that contains all of the part type and decal definitions. The default file name when using the Multi-Part Wizard is "NewParts", but you can rename that file to whatever name you chose. After the *\*.asc* file is Imported, you save the part types and decals to a library. Once in the SailWind Library, they are ready for use in a new design.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• The included extended library files; *PCBM-STARTER.plb09*, *SM\_MFR.plb09*, *CONNECTORS.plb09* and *TH.plb09* include special user defined attributes. In order to include all these attributes in your SailWind Land Patterns they must be defined in SailWind using

the Attribute Dictionary or you will receive expected Warnings. If you do not wish to import these attributes you can simply ignore the Warnings. You should review the supplied \*plb09 file attributes included to determine their desired use.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose one of the following:
	- Use the single part wizard within the Calculator:
		- i. On the toolbar, click **Wizard**.
	- Use the multi-part wizard within the Library Editor:
		- i. Open SailWind Land Pattern Creatorand use the **Library** > **Editor** command to choose the library (\*.plb09) file that contains the Land Pattern you want to create.
		- ii. Use the gray box to the left of the Land Pattern name to select Land Patterns.
		- iii. Next, either right-click and click the**Tools > Wizard** popup menu item or click **Tools > Wizard** from the menu bar to launch the "Multi-Part Wizard Dialog Box"on page 76.
		- iv. Provide the desired settings and click **Continue** to launch the Wizard.
- 2. In the CAD Tool list, select "SailWind Layout ASCII."
- 3. Match the SailWind output Version to your opened SailWind Layout version.

Importing incompatible versions can result in library corruption. A warning message appears if the files are not compatible with the running SailWind software version.

- 4. Provide the desired directory location for saving the *.asc* file.
- 5. Click either **Create** or **Create and Close** as desired.
- 6. In SailWind Layout, in a new blank design, click the **File > Import > ASCII** menu item and import the *.asc* file into the design.
- 7. Once the library parts are imported into a the blank design, right-click and click **Select Components**. The parts are imported, stacked on the origin, like when you import a netlist.
- 8. Select the component or right-click and click **Select All**.
- 9. Right-click and click **Save to Library**.
- 10. In the Save Part Types and Decals to Library dialog box, click **Select All** for both Part Types and Decals.
