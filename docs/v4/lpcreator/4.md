The PCBM-STARTER.plb09 library supplied with the software is for "Reference Only" and can contain Land Patterns with the same name as expected, with different manufacturers. This library was not intended for use with the Multi-Part Wizard and will create import errors/warnings when duplicate land pattern names are encountered.

The SM\_MFR.plb09, CONNECTORS.plb09 and TH.plb09.plb09 contain parts that were manually built in a CAD tool. You cannot view these parts in the SailWind Land Pattern Creator, but you can build them using the Multi-Part Wizard one part at a time or batch create the entire library.

**CAUTION:**

Since these land patterns were manually built, Paizi claims no responsibility of their accuracy or completeness. Please use extra caution to check these library parts prior to adding them to your CAD library.

All PLB library files are supplied free as sample land patterns and to provide you with a large selection of Land Patterns to "harvest" as applicable and are for "Reference only". Component Links, descriptions and availability, etc, as with all components, is subject to change without notice. Please see our new Link-Checker to aid you in determining broken links in both supplied sample libraries and your created library file with On-Line-Links.

**<span id="page-1-0"></span>Mode Comparison**

The Library Manager can be utilized in Search Mode or in Search and Edit Mode. Each mode has its own set of features. Understanding the differences in these features helps you to determine which mode you should use.

**Search Mode**

- Libraries can be loaded and it's contents browsed or searched. The contents of any given library may vary and may be structured to suit your needs.
- Land patterns can be opened and viewed in the calculator.
- Links to on-line or local archive data can be opened.

**Search and Edit Mode (licensed installations only)**

- All functions of Search are available.
- Find and Replace option is available.
- Libraries can be modified and saved see Help topic ["Edit Options"on page 72.](#page-5-0)
- Libraries can be verified see Help topic ["Verifying](#page-6-0) Land Patterns[" on page 73](#page-6-0).
- Libraries can be constructed or reconstructed see Help topic ["Running Multi-Part Wizard"on](#page-7-0) [page 74](#page-7-0).
- Columns may be dragged-and-dropped to create a new order. Click on any column header with the left mouse button and, while holding the button down drag the column to a new location. The library must be saved to preserve any column move changes.
- Column headers may be edited. Double-click on any column header with the left mouse button to enable column header editing.

**<span id="page-1-1"></span>Library Manager Toolbar Controls**

The Library Manager toolbar contains a broad range of buttons that provide access to all of the Library Manager functions.

**<span id="page-5-0"></span>Edit Options**

The Library Editor allows you to edit libraries while maintaining the file format required for the program. Library files may be edited to manually modify existing content, add or remove content, or create new libraries.

Opening two Editor sessions allows the contents of any library to be copied to another.

To open an existing library, select it from the Library pull down list. If the library doesn't appear in the list click the Add Lib Button to browse for the library. Documentation for all library components is, by default, contained in files with a ".plb09" file extension in a program sub directory called CADData. Upon selection, the library will load into the library display table.

To create a new library select New Library from the Library pull down list.

All editing options are available in a right-mouse-button (RMB) pop up menu.

Individual Cells may be edited by either clicking in empty cells or highlighting the contents of a cell and entering new values.

Find and Replace can be performed to edit the contents of any cell or collection of cells.

The contents of an individual cell may be copied to another cell by highlighting the contents of a cell followed by RMB copy. Move the cursor to the destination cell and RMB paste.

Individual or multiple rows can be copied by clicking on the row header (or shift-click for headers) followed by RMB copy. RMB paste will add the copied rows to the destination library.

Columns may be added, deleted or dragged and dropped to change the left-to-right order.

![](/lpcreator/4/_page_5_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Note:**

Generally, the names of any added columns are at your discretion, however there are some reserved column headings:

**• Land Pattern**

This column contains the names for all land patterns in the library and cannot be deleted.

**• Description**

This column contains a general description of the land pattern. Descriptions are automatically generated by the calculator.

**• On-Line-Link**

This column is reserved for Internet links to land pattern data.

**• Local Archive**

This column is reserved for links to land pattern data that may be stored on a local storage device such a hard drive.

Undo and Redo is available for up to 32 of the most recent edits.

Modifications that can't be undone include copy-paste operations where the source and destination have different column content. When this condition occurs, the destination columns are re mapped to include any non-existent source columns. A message will allow cancellation of the operation when this condition exists.

When finished with changes click on the **Save** toolbar button. You will then be prompted for a file name. If you keep the same name as the original file, a backup file of the original will be created with a 'bak' file extension.

![](/lpcreator/4/_page_6_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

You should not simultaneously edit parts in a particular library while using a wizard to create parts in the same library. Doing so runs the risk of overwriting the work of one with the work of the other. Additionally, any parts added by the wizard will not be observed in the editor until the library is reloaded.

**<span id="page-6-0"></span>Verifying Land Patterns**

The Verify feature is used to check land patterns that were created with a previous version of software against those same land patterns as created with the current version. This is useful in identifying changes to land pattern calculations resulting from modifications to standard calculation formulae, user preference changes or possible anomalies in the software.

Verify is performed on every land pattern that is opened in the Calculator. If a notice is generated, the 'Notice' toolbar button will flash. Clicking the button will open a message box displaying information about the notice. Not all notices indicate problems. Many are simply advisory.

A Verification Report can be generated by the Library Manager Editor and may be performed on land patterns or complete libraries that have been created using the Calculator.

**Procedure**

- 1. Load the library on which to perform Verify. For more information on selecting and loading libraries see the Help Contents section for ["Edit Options"on page 72](#page-5-0).
- 2. Select the row or rows containing the land patterns to verify by clicking on the row headers to select the full row.
- 3. Click on the **Tools** toolbar button and select the pull down option **Verify**.
- 4. Verify is performed and a report is generated containing a list of discrepancies, if any.

**Results**

Verify performs a calculation using all the same component data and settings that were used to create the original land pattern. It then compares the new calculation to the original calculation using information saved from the original calculation in the plb09 library file. The types of discrepancies that can be found with Verify are as follows:

- Differences that might result from a change to the user selected preferences or default settings.
- Differences in a that might result from a change to a program calculation method or formula.

Verify checks basic land pattern dimensions such as land lengths, widths, spacings, pad stack names, and the fundamental settings that were used in performing the calculation for those dimensions.

![](/lpcreator/4/_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Verify does not check everything!

The following are some examples of potential land pattern differences that may or may not be detected by verify:

Verify can tell you that a land pattern was created with 'Default' or 'User' Drafting or Rule preferences but that currently those same preferences are set otherwise. Other than that it will not alert you to specific differences in the actual settings. For example, it does not detect differences between original silkscreen line width and current line width but will alert you if the original silkscreen line width was set to the Default line width but the current line width is set to the User line width.

Verify will alert you to differences between settings that directly effect the land pattern functional characteristics. For example, if the current default solder mask oversize doesn't match the original a notice will be generated.

Verify does not compare a library's environment to the currently selected environment. For example, if the current default preference is to create land patterns in a nominal environment but the library being verified is in the least environment, the library will be verified against the current default least environment regardless of the selected default environment.

**<span id="page-7-0"></span>Running Multi-Part Wizard**

The Multi-Part feature is used to recreate a group of land patterns or entire libraries. This is useful for quickly converting libraries from one environment to another or rebuilding a group of land patterns to correct or modify one or more user settings. Multi-Part may be used to update the plb library data or with the Land Pattern Wizard to create land patterns for the various available CAD Tools.

**CAUTION:** Before continuing, please read ["Use Model and Disclosure for Supplied Libraries"on page 67.](#page-0-0)

**Restrictions and Limitations**

This may only be performed on land patterns that have been created using the Calculator.

**Procedure**

- 1. Load the library on which to perform the Multi-Part feature. For more information on selecting and loading libraries see the Help Contents section for ["Edit Options"on page 72](#page-5-0).
- 2. Select the row or rows containing the land patterns to create using Multi-Part.

**CAUTION:** The CAD Data (plb09) file you select will be completely overwritten!

3. On the Library Editor toolbar click **Tools** and then click **Wizard**.

**Alternative:** In the Land Pattern list, right-click, point to Tools and click Wizard.

- 4. Make your required settings in the ["Multi-Part Wizard Dialog Box"on page 76](#page-9-0).
- 5. Once the Wizard setup has been completed, CAD output options may be set in the "Land Pattern Wizard Dialog Box"on page 82.

**Results**

The ["Multi-Part Wizard Report.txt Log File"on page 78](#page-11-0) is automatically generated and displayed in your text editor.

**<span id="page-12-0"></span>Running the Link Checker**

Internet links frequently change or become obsolete. The Link Check feature may be used to verify the integrity of links to manufacturer's on-line data sheets.

A Link Integrity Check may be performed by the Library Manager Editor on land patterns or complete libraries that have been created using the Calculator and that contain the On-Line-Link attribute.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

The Link Check routine is necessarily slow and no other SailWind Land Pattern CreatorFunctions may be used when it is running. The rate at which links are checked is dependent on a number of variables but, primarily, on the speed of the Internet connection. Expect to wait about 1-2 seconds for each link you wish to check. The operation may be canceled at any time.

**Procedure**

- 1. Load the library on which to perform Link-Check. For more information on selecting and loading libraries see the Help Contents section for ["Edit Options"on page 72](#page-5-0).
- 2. Select the row or rows containing the Internet links to verify by clicking on the row headers to select the full row.
- 3. Click on the **Tools** toolbar button and select the pull down option "Check-On-Line Links."
- 4. Checks are performed. Selected rows with valid links are highlighted in green, rows with invalid links, if any, are high-lighted in red. Highlighting is removed when the currently selected or a new library file is loaded.
