## Start-up Files
Use start-up files to save color settings, the attribute dictionary, and other universal parameters and then apply them to every new *.pcb* file. To set and apply default settings use the System Default (*default.asc*) start-up file.

For information on creating start-up files, see the Specifying the Start-up Fileon page 255 and Creating Start-up Filestopics.

The provided start-up files listed in the table below show typical values for different technologies, and do not represent any specific technology.

**Table 65. Start-up Files(continued)**

**Unsupported Start-up Files**

The start-up file is an ASCII file with an *.stp* file extension.

![](/layout/guide/10/_page_1_Picture_5.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

This method of creating a start-up file is unsupported.

By design, items you can include in the start-up file are restricted by the Start-up File Output Dialog Box. Nevertheless, it is possible to export an unrestricted ASCII file using the ASCII Output dialog box. Then you could rename the extension from *.asc* to *.stp* and place the file in the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version> \Settings* folder where it would be found and used as a start-up file. For example, if you repeatedly design products using the same board outline, you could use this method to export your board outline into the start-up file. Then you would start with your board outline when beginning a new design.

Specifying the Start-up File

## Creating Start-up Files
You use the Start-up File Output dialog box to create a start-up file that contains global settings such as layer definitions, grids, clearance rules, the attribute dictionary, and so on. You can create different startup files and specify which one to use when creating a new design file. This capability enables you to save setup time when creating a new design by reusing global settings saved in a start-up file.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the current design, specify the options and preferences you want to include in the start-up file.
- 2. Click the **File> Save As Start-up File** menu item.
- 3. In the Save As dialog box, specify the start-up file name and click **Save**. The Start-up File Output Dialog Boxappears.
- 4. In the Sections area, select the check box for any of the following settings you want to include in the start-up file. If you want to select all the check boxes, click **Select All**.
- **PCB Parameters**  Global information, such as colors, layer definitions, and grids
- **Vias** Via information, such as default via type, jumpers, padstack definitions and locations
- **Layer Data**  Layer information specified in the Layers Setup dialog box, such as number of layers, layer names, routing direction for the layer, electrical type, and associations
- **Rules**  Rules information, such as clearance, routing, and high-speed
- **CAM**  CAM information related to the plot file configurations
- **Attributes**  Attribute information, such as the attribute dictionary, all attributes assigned to objects in the design, and attribute status (read only, system, ECO registered, or hidden). Values in the attribute hierarchy are not saved.

For related information, see "Modifying the Default Attribute Dictionary".

- 5. In the Units list, select the units you want to use in the start-up file. Current units provide more information than Basic units, such as grid positions.
- 6. In the Start-up File Description box, type a brief description of the global settings you are saving. The description appears when you select the start-up file in the Set Start-up File dialog box, and should help remind you of the settings in the start-up file.
- 7. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The start-up file is written to the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Settings* folder. Start-up files have an *.stp*  file extension.

Start-up Files

## Specifying the Start-up File
You use the Set Start-up File dialog box to select the start-up file to use for new design files. A start-up file contains global settings such as layer definitions, grids, clearance rules, the attribute dictionary, and so on.

Use start-up files only when creating new designs; specifying a new start-up file does not affect existing designs.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Set Start-up File** menu item.
- 2. In the Set Start-up File Dialog Box, select the start-up file and click **OK**. If you plan to use the selected start-up file for all new design files, select the Don't Display Again check box.

## Opening Files
You can open current or older design versions and reuse files. In some circumstances, when you open a file, SailWind Layout might convert the data to current formats. If another user has the file open, it is locked to any edits.

These file types can be opened:

- Design files, \*.pcb PADS Layout binary format
- Reuse files, \*.reu A physical design reuse type, known as the reuse definitionon page 1854
- Old binary files, \*.job PADS Perform V6 and PADS Work V7 format *.job* files

When you open a file in SailWind Layout, one or more conversions may take place to update your data to current data format. For more information, see File Open Conversions.

![](/layout/guide/10/_page_3_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip**

Improvements in thermal relief definition in PADS 9.2 may cause changes in thermal pad appearance, flooding results, and CAM output (for CAM Plane layers) when a design from a previous version is opened in PADS 9.2 or later. If incompatibilities are found when such a file is opened, a warning prompt is displayed and the incompatibilities are written to the *Powerpcb.Rep*  file.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Open** menu item.
- 2. In the File Open dialog box, select the file and click **Open**.

File Open Conversions

## File Open Conversions
When you open a file, some data conversions may take place to update your data to current data format.

**Copper Moved**

In some previous versions of PADS Layout you could create copper that appeared on all layers (Layer 0). SailWind Layout now requires you to create copper on a specific layer. If you open a file containing copper created for all layers, the copper is placed on Layer 1 and a message appears indicating which items were moved.

**Attributes Converted**

When you open a design, the Attribute Dictionary is loaded. You can change the default attributes that are imported by changing the default attribute dictionary.

For more information, see Default and Other Attribute Properties and Usage.

If you open a design created with a version prior to PowerPCB version 3.0 any part type attributes found are converted to new attributes, which are added to the Attribute Dictionary (if necessary), and applied to the items on which they were found. For example, if you assigned value and tolerance in your existing design, they are converted to Value and Tolerance attributes and then added to the appropriate objects.

| Attribute Name         | Created When                                                                                                                                                      |  |  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
| Value                  | A value is found appended to a part type name.                                                                                                                    |  |  |
| Tolerance              | A tolerance is found appended to a part type name.                                                                                                                |  |  |
| ASSEMBLY_OPTIONS       | Assembly Variants exist in the design.                                                                                                                            |  |  |
| DFT.Nail Count Per Net | The nail count per net is greater than one, the default.                                                                                                          |  |  |
|                        | The nail count may be greater than one if the Insert Multiple<br>Test Points Per Net check box is selected in the Audit Rules<br>tab of the DFT Audit dialog box. |  |  |

**Table 66. Items Converted to Attributes in Version 3**

**Labels Converted**

If you open a design created with a version prior to PowerPCB version 3.0, the reference designators and part types are converted to current labels. The location, orientation, and color of the labels are preserved if they were on the Top or Bottom layers. The default height and width are used, mirroring is turned off, and labels are placed on the Top layer. Also, visibility is set to Value.

For information on changing these settings see Modifying Part Label Properties.

**Differential Pair Trace Width and Gap Converted**

Width and gap for differential pair traces can be set for all layers or per layer. When you open a design, the width is set for all layers and is the larger of the recommended widths for each member of the differential pair. The gap assigned to the differential pair is set for all layers.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>For information on setting the width and gap per layer, see Creating Differential Pair Design Rules.

## Replacing Missing Fonts
Text and labels in your designs use stroke font or the system fonts installed on your system. When you open a design that uses fonts or characters that are not installed on your system, the Font Replacement dialog box—in which you can specify how the missing fonts should be replaced—opens automatically.

You can replace missing fonts automatically or manually, or you can skip the replacement process for fonts you identify. When you choose to replace fonts manually, you are asked to confirm your font selections before the replacement process initiates. If you choose to skip font replacement, you do not confirm your selections to start the replacement process, or if you cancel the replacement, the loading of the design for display on your system is cancelled, and the original design file is preserved.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Type 1 fonts are not supported.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Font Replacement Dialog Box, set the replacement mode and font for each missing font, as follows:
	- a. To accept the replacement font named in the Replace with font field, select Automatic from the Mode drop-down list.
	- b. To choose a different replacement font, select Manual from the Mode drop-down list, then select the replacement font from the Replace with font drop-down list.
	- c. To keep the existing font setting, select Skip from the Mode drop-down list. Clearances for text strings will be preserved, and objects using the missing font will appear in the display as empty boxes.
- 2. When you have made the desired settings for all the missing fonts, click **OK**.

## Archiving Your Design
You can create a folder, a PDF, and/or a zip file that contains all of your design files and supporting files. This includes the *.pcb* design file, a schematic file, libraries, and any additional files or folders you want. You choose what to archive; all fields are optional.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the design you want to archive.
- 2. Click the **File> Archive** menu item.
- 3. Select the files and folders you want in the Archiver Dialog Box.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Results**

An archive folder that contains the design and/or schematic files, the libraries, and any additional files and folders you have indicated is created.

If you chose to compress the files using the zip format, the archive folder contains only the *.zip* file, which has a filename of the following format:

<project\_name>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.zip

Where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, HH is the hour in military (24-hour) time, MM is the minute, and SS is the second of the exact time you created the file.

If you chose to create a PDF, the file is created using the design name and placed in the archive folder.
