# Chapter 25 Working With Labels
Read the topics that follow to learn more about the methods used to create, modify, and control the visibility of labels. These sections include a selection of graphical examples to guide you in setting up your label properties.

## Labels
You can create attribute, reference designator, and part type labels for components and jumpers. You can control the visibility of, justification, right-readability, and alignment of labels.

When you create labels, they may not be visible. Turn on the visibility of labels using the Display Colors Setup dialog box, where you can set the color for reference designators, part type, and attribute labels.

Unlike free text, when you add a label, there is no invisible bounding rectangleon page 1813 around the label itself.

### Label Defaults
If you create a label, but do not provide display information in the decal or in the component, SailWind Layout uses default visibility properties.

The default position for the first label is at the decal origin with no orientation, and it uses the default height and width. If a label already exists in the first position, the second position is used. The default position for the second label is under the first label position.

The figure below shows how a new height attribute label is placed in the second default position. Note that the second position is based on the first position, not where other labels are placed.

The figure below shows how a new height attribute label is placed in the third default position because the first and second positions are already filled.

### Justification Examples
You can justify free text and attribute, reference designator, and part type labels. You can set justification options when you create the label or text.

For more information, see Justifying a Label.

In the figure below, a label appears within a part outline. The label uses the default justification, which is Left, Down; meaning that the label was placed by its lower left corner.

**Figure 56. Label Within a Part Outline**

The figure below shows what happens when you change the Height and Width of the label. The label now overlaps the part outline.

**Figure 57. Label After Changing the Height and Width (with Overlap)**

|--------|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|        |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|        |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The figure below shows how you can change the Height and Width of the label and prevent the label from overlapping outlines. By changing the justification to Top, Right you change the location by which the label is placed, preventing overlap.

### Right Reading Examples
You can set the left or right reading status for free text and attribute, reference designator, and part type labels using the Label Properties dialog box. You can also use the Properties dialog box for any of the objects.

For more information, see Adding a New Part Labelor the appropriate Properties object topic.

The figures below show different reading orientations.

### Managing Reference Designators
SailWind Layout handles reference designators in the same manner as it handles attribute labels, providing flexibility in visibility and placement.

You have many options when creating and using reference designators in your design:

- Create a reference designator label and set it up for silkscreen layers. For more information, see the Moving Reference Designators to the Silkscreen Layer on page 810topic.
- Create a second reference designator label and set it up for assembly drawing layers. For more information, see the Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings on page 808 topic.
- Hide reference designators. For more information, see the Disabling Reference Designators of Selected Componentstopic.

### Labels in the PCB Decal Editor
Work with labels in the PCB Decal Editor exactly as you do in the Layout Editor. Labels in the PCB Decal Editor offer you greater flexibility; you can display either decal attributes or an attribute from an object that uses the decal. You can, for example, create a label for the part attribute Cost. Since Cost is not a decal attribute, you create the attribute in the Attribute Dictionary in the Layout Editor, and assign a placeholder label in the PCB Decal Editor.

For more information, see the Creating Placeholder Attribute Labelstopic.

When you create labels, they may not be visible. Turn on label visibility in the Display Colors Setup dialog box. On the Display Colors Setup dialog box, you can set the color for reference designators, part type, and attribute labels.

If you created a placeholder label for an attribute that exists in the Attribute Dictionary, the label is associated with the existing attribute, but it is not visible. The attribute is not, however, assigned to the part using the decal. You must manually assign it.

## Adding a New Part Label
Add labels of attributes from components or jumpers.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When working with labels, some restrictions apply:

- Reference designator is the only label available for use when you are creating labels for jumpers.
- If you do not set visibility information, default positions are used. For more information, see "Label  Defaults."
- Unlike free text, when you add a label, there is no invisible bounding rectangleon page 1813 around the label itself.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a component or jumper, right-click, and then click the **Add New Label** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Add New Part Label Dialog Box, in the Attribute list, select the attribute you want.

**Restriction:**

If you are creating labels for jumpers, Reference Designator is the only available attribute. Hidden attributes do not appear in the Attribute list unless the attribute was selected for the label before it was set as a hidden attribute.

3. The Value for Component or Value for Jumper box lists the value of the selected attribute. Accept this value, or type a new one.

![](/layout/guide/25/_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

This box is unavailable if you clicked Reference Designator or Part Type from the Attribute list, if the attribute is read-only, or if you open the Properties dialog box for different attribute types. However, if the labels you select belong to attributes of the same type, you can edit this box.

![](/layout/guide/25/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** If the attributes have different values, the box is blank. You can type a new value in the box to apply it to all of the selected attribute labels and their parent objects.Value is also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registered and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.

4. In the Show list, click the value you want to control the visibility of the label. You can choose to turn the label off, to display only the label name, to display only the label value, to display the name and value, or to display the full name and value (when labeling a structured attribute).

**Tip** Labels are invisible regardless of this setting unless you use the Display Colors Setup dialog box to change the color of labels to a color different from that of the background.

- 5. Make any additional settings required for the label.
- <span id="page-8-0"></span>6. Click **OK**.

## Selecting a Label
Set the selection filter and select a label.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use one of the following methods to set the Selection Filter:
	- With nothing selected, right-click, and then click the **Select Documentation** popup menu item.
	- Click the **Edit> Filter** menu item. In the Selection Filter dialog boxon page 114, on the **Object**  tab, select the Labels check box. Click **Close**.
- <span id="page-8-1"></span>2. Select the label.

## Deleting a Label
If desired, you can delete or remove a label from your design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the label to delete. Use the selection filter if you need help selecting the label.
- 2. Press the Delete key, or click the **Edit> Delete** menu item.

## Justifying a Label
You can justify free text and attribute, reference designator, or part type labels. You can set justification options when you create a label. You can also justify text and labels after you create them.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the label or free text.
- 2. Choose one of one of these methods to justify the label:
	- Right-click and click the **Justify Horiz** popup menu item. Then click **Left**, **Center**, or **Right** to set the horizontal Justification. Right-click again and click the **Justify Vert** popup menu item. Then click **Up**, **Center**, or **Down** to set the vertical justification.
	- Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item to open the Properties dialog box for the object and set the appropriate justification setting.
