## Creating a Drafting Object
The methods for creating all drafting objects apply in the same manner. These instructions apply to creating 2D lines, copper, copper cutouts, board outlines, board outline cutouts, keepouts, copper planes, and copper plane cut outs.

**Procedure**

- 1. After you click a button on the Drafting Toolbar, right-click to [set any values before creating the](#page-1-0) [drafting objecton page 614](#page-1-0).
- 2. Right-click and choose any of the following shapes to draw from the popup menu.
- [Circleon page 624](#page-11-0)
- [Polygon or Pathon page 623](#page-10-0)
- [Rectangleon page 624](#page-11-1)
- Chamfered pathon page 656 (copper only)

## Set Values Before Creating a Drafting Object
Use the Drafting Toolbar to add drafting objects, such as copper shapes, keepouts, and non-electrical drawn items generally not associated with placement and routing. You can set various values after you click the button for the type of item to add, but before you place the drafting object.

**Set Line Width**

Choose one of the following methods to set the width of the lines in the drafting object you are creating:

- Type W<nn>, where <nn> is the width value
- Right-click and click the **Width** popup menu item and type a value.
- Set the Default width value in the Text and Lines options on page 1553.

**Set Line Style**

For 2D lines only, choose one of the following methods to set the line style:

- Right-click and click the **Line Style** popup menu item, then choose a line style from the list.
- Type one of the LS Modeless Commandsto set the line style.

**Set Layer Placement**

Choose one of the following methods to select the layer for the placement of your drafting object:

- Type L<n>, where <n> is a layer number
- Right-click and click the **Layer** popup menu item to specify the layer where you want to place the Drafting object.
- Specify the layer using the Layer list on the Standard Toolbar.

**Set Auto Mitering of Corners**

Choose one of the following methods to auto miter corners (diagonal miter or arc):

- Right-click and click the **Auto Miter** popup menu item to miter all added corners. Define the miter type and size in the Design optionson page 1503.
- In the Design optionson page 1503 in the Miters area, select the Auto miter check box.

**Set Snap to Objects**

You can snap to existing objects instead of to locations on the design grid. You can begin drawing from an object snap point or draw to an object snap point. You can enable snapping to objects in the Object Snap Optionson page 1540 or on the popup menu while drawing drafting objects. You can also use the OS Modeless Commands.

â€¢ Right-click and click the **Snap to Objects** popup menu item.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_2_Picture_6.jpeg)

To filter the objects you can snap to, right-click, choose the **Snap to** popup menu item and then click to add or remove the check mark beside the types of objects you want to snap to.

**Set Corner Angle**

Choose one of the following methods to select a corner angle.

- Right-click and click the **Orthogonal**, **Diagonal**, or **Any Angle** popup menu item.
- In the Design optionson page 1503, in the Line/trace angle area, choose a setting.

## Edge Precision of Drafting Shapes
You often need to precisely control the edge of drafting shapes, as many factors contribute to that edge.

**Line Width**

The precision of edges is controlled by the line width used to create the shape. The default line width is set on the **Text and Lines** category of the Options dialog box. However, you can change the line width prior to, or after creating your shape. Use a very narrow outline width to achieve a sharp corner or increase the value for more blunt corners. All corners are rounded with a radius equal to one half of the outline width.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Design and Hatch Grids**

Lines are used to create the outline of the shape and are also used to create the fill inside electrical drafting items. Lines or outlines are placed on the design grid. Then shapes are filled using horizontal lines placed on the Hatch Grid.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Clearance Rules**

If you are creating a copper plane and your drafting shape is near another object, the resulting poured outline could be displaced by the clearance rules of that object.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 68. Clearance Rule Effect on the Hatch Outline**

## The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes
SailWind Layout generates the fill of copper and copper plane shapes using drafting lines drawn on the copper hatch grid. If you create the shape using a line width value less than the copper hatch grid value, it results in a hatch pattern. If you use a line width value equal to, or greater than the copper grid value, it results in a solid copper shape.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 69. Example of Solid and Hatch Pattern**

Shapes can be flooded with copper in varying degrees of hatch through to a solid pattern. The pattern used by default when you flood a shape is determined by the relative values of two settings in the Options dialog box:

- The Default width value on the Drafting / Text and Lines options category on page 1553
- The Copper hatch grid value on the Grids options categoryon page 1537

You can set line width and grid settings before or after creating the object. After you've drawn the shape, you can change the settings in the Drafting Propertieson page 1328. If you need to customize the copper hatch grid for a copper plane shape, you can set the grid value in the Flood on page 1381.

For more information on creating shapes with the desired flood pattern, see Creating a Copper Shape and "Creating a Copper Plane Manually"on page 667.

## Migration to Copper Planes
Prior to the VX.2.4 release, SailWind Layout used copper pours on "No Plane" layers and plane areas on "Split/mixed" layers. For all later releases, the software unifies copper pours and plane areas into "copper planes." If you open a design saved in an earlier version, PADS migrates or converts all copper pours and plane areas to copper planes and applies design rules accordingly. Certain clearance and connectivity changes in your design may result.

The following changes take place during the migration to copper planes:

- The "Remove unused pads" setting, found in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514, is extended to "No Plane" layers. With this setting enabled, all pads are removed on all internal "No Plane" and "Split/Mixed" layers unless the pin is connected to a trace or a copper plane on that layer. Prior to the PADS VX.2.4 release, unused pads were removed only from "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Copper pours converted to copper planes are affected by the Plane Thermal check box (in the Pin, or Via Properties dialog boxes) on page 797. Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the setting applied only to plane areas on "Split/Mixed" layers. This means, for example, if you have disabled thermal connections for a pad or via by clearing the "Plane Thermal" check box, the software removes the thermal connection to copper planes (old copper pours) on "No Plane" layers when you import the design into a newer release.
- You can apply custom thermals and custom antipads to copper planes on "No Plane" layers in addition to "Split/Mixed" layers. Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the custom thermals and antipads applied only to plane areas on "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Prior to PADS VX.2.4, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a plane area on a "Split/Mixed" layer even though a trace was connected to it. With later releases, any component pin with an attached trace does not receive a thermal connection if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting is disabled in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514. This was already the case for copper pours beginning with the PADS VX.2.3 release, and has been extended to copper planes on "Split/Mixed" layers in subsequent releases. Prior to PADS VX.2.3, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a copper pour even though a trace was connected and the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting was disabled if an additional unrouted pin pair connection existed on the pin. Via pads will still receive thermal connections to copper planes regardless of the setting.
- The plane indicators, previously only shown on "Split/Mixed" layers and "CAM Plane" layers are extended to pins and vias surrounded by a copper plane on "No Plane" layers. The Show general copper plane indicators setting is found in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514.
- One smoothing radius setting in the "Hatch and Flood Options"on page 1511 applies to all copper planes, regardless of the layer on which they reside. Previous releases had separate smoothing radius settings for copper pours and plane areas. The value from the Hatch and Flood of an existing design is retained in VX.2.4 and later releases. It may be necessary to adjust the smoothing radius value if you experience connectivity errors in a later release that were not present in the prior version.
- The setting "Remove violating thermal spokes" is removed. All violating thermals spokes are removed by default. This is a hard-coded setting that cannot be modified.
- The modeless command "PO" toggles copper planes between pour outline and the flooded hatch display. The "SPO", "SPI", and "SPD" commands are no longer used.
- The "Create cutouts around embedded planes" setting in the "Hatch and Flood Options"on page 1511 works for "No Plane" layers in addition to "Split/Mixed" layers. Previously, that setting worked for only "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Starting with VX.2.3, copper floods to the inner edge of completed cut out outlines instead of the centerline. Prior to VX.2.3, the cut out would grow by half the line width since copper would flood to its centerline rather than the inner edge which was the intended boundary. For more information, see "Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out"on page 686.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 70. Cut Out Pour Boundary Changes**

â€¢ Beginning with PADS VX.2.6, the origin of the copper plane hatch grid is calculated from the lower left corner (if one exists or calculated if one does not exist) of the pre-flooded shape. If you used a hatched fill instead of a solid fill in a pre-VX.2.6 design, the hatch grid might not have the same origin and placement of the lines of the hatch grid. As a result, pins or vias that touched and connected to the hatch grid might not be connected. Other pins that did not touch or connect to the hatch grid might be in a position to connect.

The origin of the hatch grid pattern is defined by an imaginary box surrounding the extents of the copper plane shape. The extents box is reduced by Â½ the line width of the copper plane shape and the hatch grid origin is placed in the lower left corner of the extents box. For a simple rectangular copper plane shape the hatch grid origin will be in the lower left corner of the shape. For more complex shapes, the lower left corner of the extents may be a point outside of the copper plane shape. This is not the origin of the copper plane shape, only the origin of the hatch pattern for the copper plane.

**Figure 72. Calculated Lower-Left Hatch Origin**

## Plane and Net Connectivity
A *plane* is a large copper area that provides access to universally necessary nets, like power or ground. One design may use several plane areas.

Most PCB designs locate planes on inner layers that are dedicated to the plane only, although you can place them on outer layers. The plane area can occupy all or only part of the layer.

Copper planes may have insulated traces and vias passing across the plane area, as long as the traces do not divide the plane to break connectivity.

Pins that are supposed to connect to the plane are usually plotted for manufacturing using spoked thermal relief pads. Pins that do not connect to the plane are referred to as unused pads, and are typically removed from inner layer planes and replaced with antipads.

Establishing a plane area and connecting the appropriate nets to it is usually one of the first routing tasks in the design process. The following two methods establish plane areas:

- Define a Layer as a Split/Mixed type and draw a Copper Plane
- Draw a Copper Plane on a No Plane layer

**Displaying Connectivity with General Plane Indicators**

Use the "Show general copper plane indicators" setting in the **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals**  subcategory of the Options dialog box to see which pins have thermals. The "Plane thermal" Pin Properties setting determines whether the thermal is generated for the pin.

Set the Plane Thermal option using the Properties dialog boxes for pins, vias, and jumper pins.

**Tip**

Copper Planes on a No Plane or Split/Mixed layer are functionally equivalent. Using a Split/Mixed layer provides the "Show plane nets only" check box in the Drafting Properties and use of the Plane check in Verify Design. Some other software tools may make use of a layer specifically set as Split/Mixed to utilize certain functions.

## Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object
Use the Drafting Toolbar to add drafting objects such as copper shapes, keepouts, and non-electrical drawn items generally not associated with placement and routing.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the button for the type of item to add: **2D Line**, **Copper**, **Copper Cut Out**, **Keepout**, **Copper Plane**, **Copper Plane Cut Out** or **Board Outline and Cut Out**. The add command for that object type attaches to your pointer.

## Self-Intersecting Polygons
A *self-intersecting polygon* occurs whenever a portion of a shape outline overlaps with another portion of the same shape. In some cases, creating a polygon with too large a line width for the outline can also cause overlapping of some portions.

When drafting copper planes and shapes using polygons, you can set the outline line width in the Drafting Properties Dialog Box. Choosing a narrow line width enables you to create shapes with greater accuracy in detailed areas, as shown below.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)

You can set the line width as required for your design; however, as the width increases, the shape resolution decreases. Referring to the example in the preceding figure, as the outline line width of a copper shape increases, the outer edge of the lines remain in place and the inner edges expand inward. The result appears in the figure below.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_14_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 74. Shape Detail with Increased Line Width**

If you set the outline line width too wide, the centerlines of two edge segments may overlap one another, resulting in a self-intersection polygon.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 75. Overlapping Centerlines**

**Note:**

The overlap is most visible when you turn on copper flooding.

Keep in mind that a self-intersecting polygon can occur with planes created from the board outline shape when the plane area shrinks by the clearance value. Similarly, a self-intersecting polygon can also occur when using the auto separate functionality because of the auto separate gap.

## Text
Use free text to add text information to your design. Free text is not associated to a particular design object; you can use it to add descriptions such as board identification nomenclature.

## Scaling 2D Line Objects and Dimensions
Use Scale in the 2D line or Dimension object Properties to change the size of objects.

An arc is too large if its radius is greater than 14 inches or its center is outside the database coordinate area. The database coordinate area is (-28, -28) to (28, 28) inches. Arcs are approximated with multiple straight segments.

When you scale text or dimensions, combine them with other line objects. Line widths are not scaled.

When combined text or dimension text is scaled, the maximum text height is 1000 mils and the maximum text width is 50 mils.

**Location of Scaled Objects**

If the scale model contains multiple objects and you want to maintain their relative positions, combine the objects before using Scale.

In the following figure, the two noncombined objects are scaled. The objects have individual origins, as shown on the left. These different origins are used when scaling, creating overlapping objects, as shown on the right.

**Figure 76. Noncombined Objects**

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_20_Figure_12.jpeg)

In the following figure, the two combined objects are scaled. The objects have a single origin, as shown on the left. This origin is used when scaling, creating a larger copy of the original objects, as shown on the right.

[Converting Drafting Shapes](#page-24-1) [Changing Line Widths](#page-24-2) [Scaling](#page-25-0) [Filling a Shape with Solid Copper](#page-25-1) [Changing Layers](#page-26-1)

#### Converting Drafting Shapes
You can convert a closed drafting object to another shape. In the Layout Editor, you can convert any closed drafting object to a 2D line, board outline, board cut out, copper, copper cut out, keepout, or copper plane. In the PCB Decal Editor, you can convert any closed drafting object to a 2D line, copper, copper cut out, or keepout.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When converting shapes, the following restrictions apply:

- If there is no board outline in the design, the Board Cut Out type does not appear in the Drafting Properties dialog box Type list. You must first have a board outline before you can create a board cut out.
- If there is already a board outline in the design, the Board Outline option does not appear in the dialog box because you cannot have two board outlines.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Type list, select a new shape type.

**Tip** The Copper Cut Out type is also used for cut outs in Copper Planes.

#### Changing Line Widths
You can modify the line width of drafting object outlines and fill lines as applicable.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Drafting Properties Dialog Box, in the Width box, type a value.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Restriction:** Some drafting object line widths cannot be changed.

**Note:** Like any other line width, the chamfered path does not appear as the correct width if the Minimum display width option for the design is larger than the Polygon outline width of the path. The path appears more narrow by the value of the Polygon outline width.

#### Scaling
Resize a drafting object.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a drafting item.
- 2. The object will scale up or down from the origin of the shape. If necessary, right-click and click the Set Originon page 474 popup menu item to set the origin of the scale model.
- 3. Right-click, and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 4. In the Drafting Properties Dialog Box, set scale options.

Enter a floating-point number greater than 0. Fractions are not supported. Values greater than 1 will increase the size while values less than 1 will shrink the object. A scale value of 2 will double the shape's size, a scale value of 0.5 will halve the shape's size. The line width does not scale.

5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

â€¢ If scaling changes a dimension, select the dimension, right-click, and click the **Reset Measurement** popup menu item to update the dimension measurement.

#### Filling a Shape with Solid Copper
SailWind Layout fills copper using the settings of the Copper Hatch Grid and the Drafting Default width. If desired, you can ignore these settings and fill a shape with solid copper. When you create chamfered paths, they appear as solid copper.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a copper drafting object, right-click and then click the **Properties** popup menu item
- 2. In the Drafting Properties dialog boxon page 1328, select the **Solid Copper** check box.

## Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
You can join and close 2D lines and copper shapes so that changes applied to one object apply to all of the joined objects.

[Use Join and Close to Connect 2D Lines and Copper Shapes](#page-31-1) [Joining 2D Lines and Copper Shapes](#page-32-0) [Closing 2D Lines and Copper Shapes](#page-33-0) [Breaking an Object](#page-33-1)

### Use Join and Close to Connect 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use Join and Close commands to connect 2D lines and copper shapes to create single objects for the purpose of changing their properties. For example, you can create a closed 2D line and then change its properties to "copper."

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** These commands are especially useful for after you have imported a *.dxf* file.

You can use Join and Close when the line ends are "near enough": meaning: touching, crossing slightly, or perfectly matched. If the lines are not touching or crossed too far, Join and Close will not work.

**Examples of Near Enough**

Join and Close will work on any of the following examples:

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_11.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_12.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_31_Figure_15.jpeg)

**Examples of Not Near Enough**

Join and Close will NOT work on either of the following examples:

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_32_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Limitations**

You cannot join or close when the selection includes:

- Objects that are not 2D lines (for example, a keepout)
- 2D Line shapes on different layers
- 2D Lines that are part of a reuse
- 2D Lines that are closed or a circle
- More than one connection available with the same distance

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_32_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Note:**

The connection is available if both ends are not already connected with a smaller distance.

â€¢ Shapes that cannot be joined or closed into single shape. For example, you cannot do a multiple Join or Close.

### Joining 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use the Join command to connect any 2D lines or copper shapes that are "near enough."

For more information, see "[Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes"](#page-31-0).

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the two 2D lines or copper shapes you want to join. The objects must be near enough.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Join** popup menu item.
- If two segments cross near enough to their ends, the two segments are shortened and the cross point is the point where they are joined
- If the segments do not cross, an additional segment is added

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "2D Line" in the Status bar. You can now select the entire joined object.

If the command did not work, you should see the error message: "Join command aborted" in the Output Window.

### Closing 2D Lines and Copper Shapes
Use the Close command to create a closed (and joined) shape that has contiguous lines. The objects must be "near enough" for the command to be effective.

For more information, see "[Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes.](#page-31-0)"

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the 2D lines or copper shapes you want to close. The objects must be near enough.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Close** popup menu item.

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "2D Line" in the Status bar. You can now select the entire closed object.

If the command did not work, you should see the error message: "Close command aborted" in the Output Window.

### Breaking an Object
You can break any 2D Line or copper shape that is not a single straight line or a single arc into multiple 2D Lines. The Break command creates a "break point" at every corner of the shape.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot break a circle or elements that belong to a reuse.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object you want to break.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Break** popup menu item.

**Results**

If the command worked, you should see "Multiple Selection" in the Status bar. You can now select each segment separately.
