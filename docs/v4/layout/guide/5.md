# Chapter 5 Setting Colors
You can set and apply colors in SailWind Layout in one of four ways: to all design objects globally, to individual nets, to design objects set up in the Decal Editor, and to design objects in the CAM document output.

- **Design**  Use the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box to set colors to objects on each layer.
- **Nets**  Use the View Nets Dialog Box to set colors to individual nets.
- **Decal**  Use the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box within the Decal Editor. Once you bring the decal into a design, the decal assumes the design colors. You can change colors in the Decal Editor; however, the colors remain for the duration of your editing session with the decal only. When you change the decal, it reverts back to the defaults.
- **CAM**  Use the Select Items Dialog Boxto set colors to objects in CAM before printing the CAM document. You must have a color printer for the colors to be available in the Select Items dialog box.

The following topics cover the Design color settings.

## Setting Colors for the Design
As you work on a layout design, you can customize display colors to make it easier to see objects as you place them.

Using the Display Colors Setup dialog box, you can:

- Set and change the color of objects on a per layer or per object type basis.
- Make objects visible or invisible in the display (also on a per layer or per object type basis).
- Customize the palette of color selections.
- Save your customizations in a configuration file.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.

![](/layout/guide/5/_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** You can clear the Display Colors Setup dialog box of the preset color assignments in the Layers/Object Types. Click **Assign All** and in the Assign Color to All Layers dialog box, click Assign Background Color to All Objects and then click **OK**.

2. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box, set the color(s) for design objects:
	a. To set the color for one object, in the Selected Color area, click a color tile. Then in the Layers/ Object Types table, click the color tile for the object type in the correct layer row.

**Tip** To change the palette of colors from which you can select, see "Changing the Color  Palette".

b. To make all objects on a layer the same color, click the layer number to select the entire row, and then click the color tile in the Selected Color area.
c. To make an object the same color on all layers, click the object name to select the entire column, and then click the color tile in the Selected Color area.
d. To make an object type invisible, set its tile to the background color. You can make multiple objects invisible (for example, all objects on the same layer). For more information, see "Hiding Design Objects".

**Tip** To automatically make an object type the same color on all layers, use the Assign Color to All Layers dialog box.on page 1094

3. Click **OK**. The display reflects your color settings.

**Results**

When you save the design, SailWind Layout stores the settings with design data.

You can save display color settings you commonly use as you work on a design. See "Saving Color Assignments to a File".

You can use modeless commands to make pin numbers and net names visible or invisible. See "Making Pin Numbers and Net names Visible or Invisible".

Color configurations saved in PowerPCB versions 2.1 and lower cannot be used in PowerPCB versions 3.0 and higher.

## Changing the Color Palette
You can change the color tiles that appear in the color palette. Changing the color tiles allows you to quickly choose custom colors.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
2. In the Display Colors Setup dialog boxon page 1318, in the Selected Color area, click the color tile that you want to change.
3. Click **Palette**.
4. In the Color dialog box, click the color value you want to use. You can also create a custom color. Refer to the Windows Help for more information on changing the Windows color palette.
5. Click **OK** to return to the Display Colors Setup dialog box. You may need to click the selected color tile again to see the color change. The new color appears in the tile you selected.
6. Click **OK** to close the Display Colors Setup dialog box.

**Results**

You can bring back the original color palette by clicking **Default Palette**.

## Making All Objects Visible
The Assign Colors to All Layers dialog box contains several shortcuts for quickly assigning colors to all layers, including the background color.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
2. In the Display Colors Setup dialog boxon page 1318, click **Assign All**.
3. In the Assign Color to All Layers Dialog Box, click Automatically Make Objects Visible.
4. In the Color Preference list, select one of the following:
	- **One Color Per Object Type** Assigns one color for a certain object type on all layers. For example, assign the color which is currently set to the background color, on all layers,
	- **One Color for a Layer**  Assigns color for all objects, which are currently set to the background color, on the same layer.
	- **Selected Color**  Assigns a color you select from the Display Colors Setup dialog box color matrix to all objects, which are currently assigned the background color, on all layers.
5. Click **OK** to return to the Display Colors Setup dialog box.
6. Click **OK** to close the Display Colors Setup dialog box.

**Results**

You can also use the same dialog box to make objects invisible. See "Hiding Design Objects".

## Hiding Design Objects
When you are placing or routing components in a layout design, it can be helpful to make certain objects visible in the display and others invisible. For example, you might want to make objects on the power, ground, and bottom layers invisible when you are routing on the top layer.

You can also hide individual net connections or traces using the View Nets Dialog Box.

When you are working in the design, you can make pin numbers or net names invisible (or visible again) using modeless commands. See "Making Pin Numbers and Net names Visible or Invisible".

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.

![](/layout/guide/5/_page_3_Picture_7.jpeg)

2. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box, use the method that matches what you want to do:
	- **Make one object type invisible**  Set its tile to the background color.
	- **Make all objects on a layer invisible**  Clear the check box to the right of the layer name. For specific information on hiding layers including shortcuts, see "Hiding Layers".
	- **Make an object type invisible on all layers**  Clear the check box above the column for that object type.
	- **Make all objects invisible**  Change their colors on all layers to the background color. Click **Assign All**. In the Assign Color to All Layers Dialog Box, click Assign Background Color to All Objects. You might use this option as a quick way to clear the display of objects except for board outline and connections, whose colors are set in the Other area.
3. Click **OK**.

## Hiding Layers
Hide layers in the design to reduce clutter in the display. The invisible layers are still listed in dialogs and the layer list, but are invisible in the design.

![](/layout/guide/5/_page_3_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** A wide array of shortcuts for hiding layers is available as modeless commands. See the "Modeless Commands for Layer Visibility (Quick Layer View) on page 83" table.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
2. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box, clear the check box to the right of the layer name that you want to hide. As an alternative, you could use the Z modeless command to hide a specific layer. For example, type Z -2 to hide layer 2 from view.

**Results**

The layer is hidden without affecting the color tiles of the objects on that layer. You could achieve the same effect by assigning the background color to all the objects on the layer but then you would have to reassign colors to the layer objects to make them visible again.

## Making Pin Numbers and Net names Visible or Invisible
While working in a layout design, you can use modeless commands to turn display of net names and pin numbers on or off.

- See the PN modeless command in the "Modeless Commands for Object Visibility table" on page 83.
- See NN, NNP, NNT, and NNV modeless commands in the "Modeless Commands for Net Name Visibility table on page 83".

## Pin Number and Net Name Display Options
You can set the text size of displayed net names and pin numbers, and the maximum allowable gap between net names on traces.

Use the Display category of the Options dialog boxon page 1525.

## Saving Color Assignments to a File
You can save color assignments you have specified in the Display Colors Setup dialog box to a file.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
2. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box, set the color assignments you want.
3. Click **Save** in the Configuration area.
4. In the Save Configuration dialog box that appears, type the configuration name.
- You are not prompted if you overwrite an existing color configuration.
- To save the current color settings under an existing configuration, select the configuration name from the configuration list and click **Save**. Name the new configuration with the old file name. The file is overwritten.

**Results**

The current color settings are saved under the new name. Configurations are saved in the *C: \<install\_folder>\<version>\Settings* folder as the saved name with a *.ccf* extension. To change the default display colors setup, name the color configuration *default.ccf*.

To use a previously saved configuration, select the configuration name from the Configuration list.

To delete a configuration, select the configuration in the list and click **Delete**.

## Make Permanent Changes to the Display Colors
The Display Colors of the Design Editor and the PCB Decal Editor only change for the current Design or Decal. To make permanent changes to the colors, you must create a new default start-up file for the Design Editor or the PCB Decal Editor.

For the Design Editor, see "SailWind Layout Default Settings".

For the PCB Decal Editor, see "Creating a New Default Decal Editing Environment".
