| Standard Toolbar                                | The Standard toolbar contains commands that open and save<br>designs, change the view, redraw, and access the Drafting,<br>Design, Dimensioning, ECO, and BGA toolbars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Work Area                                       | The area in which you enter all design information is called<br>the work area or the workspace. The work area contains two<br>editors: the Layout editor and the PCB Decal editor. The Layout<br>editor appears when you open SailWind Layout. You can place,<br>route, and otherwise modify your board in this editor. The PCB<br>Decal Editor is an editor that you start (through the Tools menu)<br>where you can create or edit a decal.                         |
|                                                 | The maximum work area is a 56 by 56 inch square. You can<br>measure it in inches, mils, or metric units. Set the units of<br>measure in Global Options. The work area is divisible by an<br>X,Y, or horizontal and vertical grid, which you can set to a<br>minimum of .00001" between points. You can set the X and Y<br>values separately. This is called the Design Grid on the Grids<br>tab of the Options dialog box.                                            |
| Status Bar                                      | The status bar displays a command name or information on a<br>selected connection, route, or component. The layer on which a<br>selected trace exists appears on the status bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| System Status Indicator                         | The system status indicator shows the processing state of the<br>application in the upper left corner of the work area. It appears<br>green when the system is idle or ready for operation, and red<br>when the system is unavailable either because the system is<br>processing or the work space cannot receive user input, such<br>as when in CAM.                                                                                                                 |
| Point of Origin                                 | The 0,0 coordinate location. X,Y coordinates are calculated<br>from this point. When you create a new file, the default drawing<br>format is centered at medium magnification in the work area<br>with the origin, or the 0,0 point, in the lower left corner. The<br>origin appears as a large white dot. As you move the cursor,<br>its position relative to the origin appears in the X,Y Coordinates<br>area. The numbers change in multiples of the design grid. |
| Layout-Router Synchronization<br>Mode Indicator | Displays whether SailWind Layout and SailWind Router are<br>in Synchronization mode. Also indicates which program is<br>the active one versus the inactive one or whether the inactive<br>program is out of sync.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Trace/Line Width                                | Displays the current line width setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Design Grid X,Y Spacing                         | Displays the setting of the Design grid. When you move an<br>object or use a drafting command, the grid readout is replaced<br>by a Delta X and Y reading, calculated from the cursor selection<br>point when the command starts. Negative numbers indicate left<br>and down.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Panning Overview
The are many ways to pan around your design. Use the middle mouse button or the middle mouse wheel as the most efficient ways to pan.

- **Center the view based on the pointer location**  Point in the workspace to where you want to locate the new center of the view and middle-click or press the Insert key. The screen repaints the design with the point you chose at the center of the screen.
- **Dynamically pan in the workspace**  Hold down the Alt key and the middle mouse button and drag the pointer in the direction you want to move. When the design is in the spot you want, release the middle mouse button.
- **Move the view based on a miniature representation of the design area**  In the Status windowon page 1733 click on the design representation to center the view and pan to that area.
- **Scroll vertically and horizontally**  Use the pointer and the scroll bars, or use the mouse wheel for vertical scrolling and press the Shift key while you use the wheel for horizontal scrolling.
- **Move the view one-half screen horizontally or vertically**  Turn on the NumLock and use the arrow keys on the number pad.
- **Move the view one grid unit horizontally or vertically**  Use the arrow keys with NumLock Off.

## Zooming Overview
The most efficient way to zoom is using the middle mouse button. There are also shortcuts to zoom to the board outline, the extents of all design items, or a selected item.

There are many ways to zoom:

- **Zoom to the board outline**  Press Ctrl+B, or on the Standard Toolbar click the **Board** button, or on the View menu click **Board**, or press the Home key. This zooms to and centers the board outline in the workspace.
- **Zoom to the extents of all design items**  Press Ctrl+Alt+E, or on the Standard Toolbar click the **Extents** button, or on the View menu click **Extents**. This zooms to fit all objects, including those outside the board outline, into the workspace.
- **Zoom to the selection**  Select a design object and press Alt+Z, or on click the **View > Selection** menu item. Any object you select becomes centered in the view of the workspace.

Alternatively, in the Project Explorer window, right-click and click the **Zoom to Selection** popup menu item. Then click a component, PCB decal, or net in the Project Explorer. In the Project Explorer, the right-click > **Allow Selection** popup menu item must be selected in order for the Zoom to Selection feature to work. If either of these options already have a check mark, and you click them again, you turn them off.

• **Zoom in to a defined area with the middle mouse button** — Move the pointer to the center of the desired zoom area. Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the pointer diagonally up across the design, indicating both the horizontal and vertical limits of the bounding box that defines your next view. When the area want to magnify is within the bounding box, release the mouse button. The zoom-in ratio also appears with the cursor.

Alternatively, instead of zooming from the center as in the above, you can also zoom from the corner by holding down the Shift key while you drag the pointer with the middle mouse button.

• **Zoom out of a defined area with the middle mouse button** — Move the pointer to the center of the desired zoom area. Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the pointer diagonally down across the design, indicating both the horizontal and vertical limits of the bounding box that defines your next view. The box in the center represents the current view size. The outer box that expands from the center box represents the new view size in proportion to the old. The zoom-out ratio also appears with the cursor.

Alternatively, instead of zooming from the center as in the above, you can also zoom from the corner by holding down the Shift key while you drag the cursor.

- **Zoom in and out with a two button mouse**  On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Zoom** button. This button is a toggle. The left mouse button now functions like a middle mouse button (see instructions earlier in this topic) allowing you to define an area for zooming. You can also place the pointer at the desired view center and click the left mouse button to zoom in, or click the right mouse button to zoom out. Click the **Zoom** button or press the Esc key to exit zoom mode to return the mouse to its normal functionality.
- **Zoom using the mouse wheel**  Press and hold the Ctrl key as you rotate the wheel button.
- **Zoom using the keyboard**  To zoom with a defined area, press the 5 key on the numeric keypad with NumLock on. This puts the pointer in zoom mode like holding the middle mouse button. To zoom in at the pointer, press the Page Up key on the numeric keypad. To zoom out at the pointer, press the Page Down key on the numeric keypad.

## Design Origin and Workspace
The design space measures 56 inches X 56 inches. New designs begin with the design origin located at the -18", -18" of the overall workspace. With the origin at this point in the workspace, it is helpful to keep the origin at the lower left of your board outline. Otherwise, you can change the location of the design origin within the workspace.

When you change the location of the origin, you receive a message that references the new location based on the old origin location and also provides coordinates in parenthesis based on the centerpoint of the workspace. By displaying your origin location based on the design space centerpoint, you can determine by the size requirements of your board whether you will reach the limits of the design space based on the placement of your design origin. From the workspace centerpoint, you have from -28" to +28" on both the x and y axis.

Setting the Origin by Click Setting a Precise Origin Location

### Setting the Origin by Click
Use the pointer to set the origin location for the design.

**Procedure**

1. **Setup> Set Origin**.
2. Click where you want the new origin to be. You are prompted to accept the new origin and are given the coordinates of the new origin location based on the grid of the original origin.

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_5_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** The message also displays coordinates in parentheses, of the new origin location based on the centerpoint of the workspace.

### Setting a Precise Origin Location
If you want a more precise location, you can set the origin to any of the following: a component origin, a pin, a drawing corner, a via, text, the center of a circle, or a line (or arc) Intersection.

1. Select the object with the point you want the new origin to be.
2. Click the **Setup> Set Origin** menu item. Alternatively, you can use the SO Modeless commands on page 83. The SO modeless command also allows you to set the origin to absolute coordinates of the design space.

## Redraw of the Display
Occasionally, fragments or an outline of an object might appear where the object no longer exists. If you see remnants of objects that you have moved, or you see lines where there are actually no design objects, you can force a complete full screen redraw from the video card. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Redraw** button.

## Cycling Through Design Views
Each time you change the view of your design workspace, SailWind Layout records the view. You cycle back and forth through views that you have created by panning and zooming the workspace.

**Procedure**

1. Change the view of the workspace.
2. To return to the previous view, click the **View > Previous View** menu item.
3. To restore the original view, click the **View > Next View** menu items.

Saving and Restoring a View

## Saving and Restoring a View
If you are frequently viewing an area of your design, you can save a view of the design area and quickly restore it instead of panning and zooming to the view every time. You can save up to nine views. The ability to save views is not available in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

1. Pan to and set the zoom level of the view you want to save.
2. Click **View > Save View**. The Save View Dialog Box appears.
3. Click **Capture**.
4. In the Capture a New View box, type a name and click **OK**.

**Results**

The view names appear at the bottom of the View menu for quick selection. You can also click **View > Save View** to revisit the views that you captured, and then manage the list of views. You can delete ones that are no longer useful. The Save View dialog box displays the current view as a blue square in the miniature representation of the design area. Any selected view names are displayed as red squares.

## Software Launch Options
You can use software launch options, known as *command line switches*, to control the initial SailWind Layout configuration. These switches can open a file, start macros, and record a SailWind Layout session. You can use multiple command line options.

You add command line switches to the Start menu shortcut. See "Adding Start-up Options to a Shortcut".

**Table 2. SailWind Layout Command Line Options (continued)**

## Adding Start-up Options to a Shortcut
You can add various start-up options to the properties of a shortcut, such as starting up SailWind Layout with a specific project already opened.

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you create your own shortcuts, copy the Start menu shortcuts instead of generating ones from the executables in the install directory. Start menu shortcuts contain a "wrapper" that allows the proper environment variables to be defined as the program launches.

1. In the shortcut properties, click in the box with the pathname.
2. Press the End key, press the Spacebar key, and then type the command line switch you want to use. Enclose with double quotes " " each string that contains a space. When specifying a file to

start, do not use a / before the file name. You can specify multiple command line switches. For example, to start the program with *preview.pcb*, the command line might read:

"\<install\_folder>\<version>\Programs\SailWindPCB.exe" "C:\SailWind projects\Samples \preview.pcb"

## Output Window
Use the Output Window for displaying reports and session logs, macro editing, and debugging.

The Output Window is located in the bottom section of the display window. You can dock or float, and display or hide the Output Window.

See the following for more information on the tabs of the Output Window:

- The Status Tab
- The Macros Tab

## The Status Tab
The Status tab displays information on the current session. You can use the Status tab to work with HTML documents. Although it is not a Web browser, you can use it to open Internet Web pages that any links reference.

If the Status tab is closed, and you get an error while performing tasks, the output window automatically opens with the Status tab active.

Use the Status tab to:

- Record, display, and print the session log.
- Print and display report files.
- Print and display web pages.
- Open program files.

A software session status log, which appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window, contains all program output for the current session, including names of opened and saved files, integrity test results, and messages.

The default path for the session log comes from the *.ini* file entry *FileDir=C:\SailWind Projects*.

The status log presents different types of information in different colors. Text color representations are shown in the following table:

| Color | Meaning                                                                              |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Red   | Errors                                                                               |
| Green | Warnings                                                                             |
| Black | Messages                                                                             |
| Blue  | Links to files, Web pages, and database objects. These items<br>are also underlined. |

**Table 3. Status Log Text Color Representations**

Page Navigation in the Status Tab Filtering the Messages in the Status Tab Searching Text in the Status Tab Printing Status Log Messages Reports Inside the Status Tab

### Page Navigation in the Status Tab
Instead of reports opening in your default text editor, you can set up SailWind Layout so they can open and display them inside the **Status** tab like new pages in a web browser. Using the toolbar buttons, you can navigate to the previous page, the next page, and refresh a display of reports and other pages. You can also stop updates to pages, and return to the status log display.

To perform these functions, use the following **Status** tab toolbar buttons:

| Button  | Description                                       |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Back    | Displays the previous page.                       |
| Forward | Displays the next page.                           |
| Stop    | Stops page updates.                               |
| Refresh | Refreshes the display of reports and other pages. |
| Home    | Returns to the session status log.                |

**Table 4. Status Tab Navigation Toolbar Buttons**

### Filtering the Messages in the Status Tab
You can choose which types of messages to display in the status log of the Output Window.

**Procedure**

1. Right-click in the log area of the **Status** tab, point to the **Filter** popup menu item, and on the popup submenu, click to place a check beside any one or combination of the following items:

| Menu Item | Description                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Message   | Displays messages (black text)                             |
| Warning   | Displays warning messages (green text)                     |
| Error     | Displays error messages (red text)                         |
| Show all  | Displays all messages types (error, warning, and message). |

**Table 5. Filter Popup Submenu Items**

**Tip**

Check marks indicate which message types are turned on for viewing in the log.

2. Click a checked menu item to clear the check and filter the log removing the display of those messages. Those message types are hidden until they are displayed again. They are not deleted from the log.

### Searching Text in the Status Tab
Similar to searching in a document, you can search text in the **Status** tab. For example, after a long software session, you might want to look for a report from a previous state of the design. You can search for the report name instead of visually searching by scrolling through the log.

**Procedure**

1. In the Output Window, in the **Status** tab, click the **Search** button.
2. In the Find dialog box, type the text you want to find and set any other options if required. The search begins as soon as you start typing a word and scrolls through the log to the first occurrence of the work, highlighting the word.
3. If the search does not immediately find the correct occurrence of your search, click the **Next** or **Previous** buttons to cycle through the occurrences.
4. When finished, close the Find dialog box.

### Printing Status Log Messages
You can print a hard copy of the session's status log for review purposes.

**Procedure**

1. In the Output Window, in the **Status** tab, click the **Print** button.
2. In the Windows Print dialog box, set options as needed.
3. Click the **Print** button.

### Reports Inside the Status Tab
The session status log contains links to reports that you can view and print. Links appear in blue, underlined lettering. While most reports open in your default text editor, you can design some reports to open within the **Status** tab.

If you click a link and a report opens in the **Status** tab instead of your default text editor, you must use the **Home** button to return to the status log. For more information, see "Page Navigation in the Status Tab".

To print a report that appears in the **Status** tab, follow the same instructions for printing the status log. For instructions, see "Printing Status Log Messages".

## Changing the Default Text Editor
Reports open in the default text editor. You can change the default text editor used with SailWind Layout by changing the "Editor" entry in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file.

If you choose Notepad as the default text editor, longer files may not be loaded because of size constraints in Notepad.

1. Open the *SailWindpcb.ini* file in a text editor. By default it is located in the following folder —*C: \<install\_folder>\<version>\Settings*.
2. In the [general] section, specify a new text editor executable name after "Editor=". Include the drive and folder if the new editor is not in your Windows folder.
3. Save the *.ini* file and close the text editor.

## Locked Files
The SailWind products help you avoid making changes to a file that another user has already opened. The first user to open a file in a shared location becomes the owner of the file for the duration the file is open; the file locks out all other users. If you try to open a file that someone else has already opened, you get a warning message letting you know the current owner and the name of the computer from where the file is locked.

You have the option to view a read-only version of the file, but you will not be able to update it while the owner still has it open. You can save the file with another name using the **File> Save As** menu item.

## SailWind Layout Default Settings
The default system and design settings (Options, Colors, Rules, Layer stackup, Vias, CAM, and Attributes) are preset by the *default.asc* and *decaledt.asc* files. The file *default.asc* contains design mode settings, and the file *decaledt.asc* contains decal editor mode settings.

You can create your own start-up file to customize the software launch defaults. For more information, see "Creating Start-up Files".

## Software Interface Customization
You can customize the software interface to suit your work style and design work. You can determine which toolbars to display, add items to toolbars and menus, and create custom toolbars, menus and shortcut keys.

Your customizations are saved with your current workspace so that all of the changes you make to toolbars, menus, and shortcut keys are present when you work in that workspace again.

See the following subtopics for specific information:

Hiding Windows Automatically Detaching Windows from the Current View Attaching Windows to the Current View

### Hiding Windows Automatically
You can also set a window to hide automatically so that it appears when you hover the pointer near it, and automatically minimizes when you move the pointer away from it.

**Procedure**

1. Move your pointer to the right side of the title bar in the window you want to hide.
2. Click the thumbtack in the window title bar. The thumbtack picture changes to point sideways . A new bar appears on the side of the interface. The side on which the bar appears depends on the location of the window. For example, if the Project Explorer is located on the left side of the user interface, when you click the Auto Hide setting from the menu, the new bar appears on the left side of the interface. The new bar contains a tab that has the same name as the window.
3. Hover over the tab in the new bar. The window reappears, covering the application.
4. Move the pointer away from the window. The window minimizes to a tab.

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_30_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** To turn off the Auto Hide feature, hover over the tab in the new bar so the window reappears. Then repeat steps 1-2 in reverse.

### Detaching Windows from the Current View
You can detach a window from the current view. This is called *floating*. A floating window does not attach to the current view; instead, it hovers, blocking the view to anything behind it.

1. If the window is currently set to hide automatically, first turn off the Auto Hide feature.
2. Double-click the window title bar. The window detaches and you can move it to any part of the screen. To undo floating, see "Attaching Windows to the Current View".

### Attaching Windows to the Current View
You can attach a window to the current view. This is called *docking*. A docked window does not block the view to anything behind it.

You can dock a window in its last docked location, or dock a window to a different location.

Docking to the Last Location Docking to a New Location Embedding Two Windows Within One Window Space Creating Tabs Within Windows

#### Docking to the Last Location
You can dock a window to its previous docked location.

**Procedure**

1. Select the window to dock.
2. Double-click the window title bar. The window reattaches to the interface.

#### Docking to a New Location
Dock a window to a new location using the cursor.

**Procedure**

<span id="page-31-3"></span>1. Using the title bar, drag the window. When you start dragging the window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. At the edges of the user interface, arrows containing graphics appear, as shown in Figure 2.

**Figure 2. Window Dragging Graphic**

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_31_Picture_15.jpeg)

A similar group of arrows appears in a group near the center of the screen. Ignore that group of arrows for this procedure.

2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows on the edge of the user interface. For example, hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface. A transparent colored block appears along the side of the user interface to which you are pointing. This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse button. For example, if you hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface, a block appears along the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 3.

**Figure 3. Docking a Window**

3. Release the mouse button while hovering over the arrow that indicates where you want to dock the window. The window docks to the user interface, and the other windows in the user interface resize.

#### Embedding Two Windows Within One Window Space
If desired, you can embed a window within another window space to improve the efficiency of the work area.

**Procedure**

1. Using the title bar, drag a window into another window. When you start dragging a window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. A group of arrows containing graphics appears in the center of docked windows into which you are dragging, as shown below. Depending on the window in which you are dragging, the group of arrows may also have a tab graphic in the center.

**Figure 4. Dragging a Window—Arrow Group**

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_33_Figure_4.jpeg)

A similar group of arrows appears at the sides of the user interface. Ignore those arrows for this procedure.

2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows. For example, hover over the left arrow. A transparent colored block appears along the side of the window you are dragging, as shown below. This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse button. For example, if you hover over the left arrow, a block appears along the left side of the Output Window.

**Figure 5. Dragging and Docking a Window**

3. Release the mouse button while hovering over the arrow that indicates where you want to dock the window. The window is embedded within another window, both sharing the space the original window occupied.

**Tip**

To maximize your workspace, try setting these embedded windows to hide automatically. Ctrl-click the thumbtack in one of the window title bars, and all of the windows within the original window frame hide automatically.

#### Creating Tabs Within Windows
Create a tab of your window within the space occupied by another window.

**Procedure**

1. Using the title bar, drag a window into another window. When you start dragging a window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. A group of arrows containing graphics appears in the center of the window into which you are dragging, as shown below. Depending on the window into which you are dragging, the group of arrows may also have a tab graphic in the center.

4. To rearrange the tab, drag the tab to a new position within the row of tabs.
5. To move an embedded window, drag the tab out of the window in which it is embedded and the tab will convert back into a window that you can place where desired.

**Tip** To maximize your workspace, try setting these embedded windows to hide automatically. Ctrl-click the thumbtack in one of the window title bars, and all of the windows within the original window frame hide automatically.

## Transparent View Mode
Use Transparent Mode to view traces on several layers simultaneously. Transparent mode can show you hidden obstacles directly under the current active layer.

To toggle transparent view mode, use the Modeless Commandon page 83 T.

With Transparent mode you can view traces on several layers at once. Transparent mode can show obstacles that may be hidden directly under the current active layer. When Transparent mode is on, you see trace-over-trace, trace-over-part outline, copper-over-trace overlaps drawn in a third, lighter color. The overlap color is determined by the colors you assign to your traces. With Transparent mode off, overlaps do not appear.

![](/layout/guide/2/_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 9. A Routed Board with Transparent Mode Off and On**

You should use transparent mode for inspecting dense route areas or when routing in areas with layerspecific obstructions.

**Color Selection and Transparent Mode**

The transparent effect is more visible if you use darker colors for traces. Bright colors like yellow and aqua wash out the effect.

**Figure 10. A Thirty Two Color Grid with Transparent Mode Off and On**

**Tip**

Items that you select may not clear normally and may remain highlighted until you click **Redraw**  on the toolbar.

## Outline View Mode
Use Outline mode to speed redraw time by displaying traces and pads as outline objects instead of filled objects. Traces appear as two parallel lines, separated by the established trace width. Pads appear as outlines of their shapes.

To toggle outline view mode, use the Modeless Commandon page 83 O.

**Resolution Options**

With resolution options, modeless commands 'OL' and 'OH' on page 83, you can change the display resolution for faster redraw of very large designs. High resolution, which is the default, displays objects in their true shape. Low resolution displays pads as square or rectangular objects. The last resolution setting you used is saved, for example, if you set low resolution, selecting outline mode toggles between normal view and low resolution mode.

## Bottom View
You can change the view of the design space to view your PCB design from behind. Enable this bottom view to help visualize the placement of components or the placement of reference designators on the bottom side of the board.

Use one of the following to toggle Bottom View:

- **View > Bottom View** menu item
- Standard Toolbar > **Bottom View** button
- Use the B modeless commandon page 83
- Press Alt-B

The entire design space is mirrored. Moving the cursor to the left results in a positive move on the x axis while in Bottom View.

If you have enabled the Active layer comes to front setting in the Global Optionson page 1531, the active layer remains at the front when you switch to Bottom View. If the Active layer comes to front setting is disabled when you switch to Bottom View, you will see the bottom layer at the front regardless of which layer is active.

## Fonts
Text strings and labels in your designs can use stroke font and/or system fonts that are installed on your system.

- You can set fonts for each text string and label you create in your design, choosing stroke font or system fonts for each selection. You can also have a combination of stroke font and system fonts within the same design.
- You can search for fonts used for text strings or labels, and can then open the item Properties to apply a different font name and style to all objects that you select for modification.
- Designs to be output to printers and plotters can also use both stroke fonts and system fonts. When making font selections, consider the following:
- System font text is supported in RS-274X Gerber format when Fill mode is on and is output as a set of filled polygons. For more information see the settings in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box.
- System fonts are not supported in the RS-274D CAM output format. If you attempt to use this output format with system fonts, the program displays a warning message. If you proceed, system fonts will not be output. Instead, you should use the RS-274X format with system fonts.
- If the design uses fonts or character sets that are not installed on your system, a font substitution process begins automatically when the file is loaded. During this process, you are asked to choose fonts to substitute for those that are missing from your system. For instructions, see "Replacing Missing Fonts".
- For systems using languages that do not include stroke font, English stroke font is used.
- Non-ASCII symbols, such as +/-, ohm, and degrees are available on your system for the installed fonts you select. If the character sets you choose are not available, a blank space or blank text box appears where the symbols should be. In this case, choose character sets that are available on your system to enable the symbols to display in your design.

When you open an existing design that was created on a system without system font supported, you must choose whether to use stroke or system fonts for every text string or label in the design. To convert the existing text or label fonts to another font, use the Text on page 1750 or Part Label Propertieson page 1603 dialog box. To find fonts easily, use the Find Dialog Box.
