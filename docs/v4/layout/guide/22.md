# Chapter 22 SailWind 3D
As an alternative to standard two dimensional board layout, SailWind Layout provides a three dimensional, graphical representation of your project in the SailWind 3D window. In addition to allowing interactive component placement, the SailWind 3D window also renders your board layout in a realistic three dimensional view, thereby letting you preview your design, perform physical measurements from one component to the next, and check clearances with imported mechanical designs, such as mounting brackets.

## SailWind 3D Overview
The SailWind 3D window provides a three-dimensional rendering of your PCB layout, including electronic components and mechanical assemblies (such as mounting brackets or connectors). This threedimensional representation allows you to examine the PCB construction, move and align components,

and check clearances between components on your PCB and adjacent assemblies (such as EMI shields, heat sinks, and covers). The SailWind 3D window also provides tools for aiding in the design collaboration process with mechanical (MCAD) designers.

**Part Placement in SailWind 3D**

One of the primary purposes of the SailWind 3D window is to allow you to view a three-dimensional representation of your design to check clearances between components and surrounding assemblies or mechanical parts in the X, Y, and Z direction.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)

However, if desired, you can synchronize the SailWind 3D window with the two-dimensional layout design view, meaning selecting and moving a part in one view updates the part's position in the other view. This synchronization feature becomes helpful if you choose to place parts in your PCB design using the SailWind 3D window instead of the standard two-dimensional layout design view.

Using the SailWind 3D window, you can assign or "map" 3D models to your parts, thereby giving them an accurate three-dimensional representation (see Assigning a 3D Model to a Component). You then have the option of saving the 3D model mapping for re-use with other designs by saving it to the Reuse folder

location for a netlist project — see 3D Model Mapping. Alternatively, you can keep it mapped to part in the PCB design only.

For 3D model alignment, the SailWind 3D window appears adjacent to the Decal Editor along with the Align 3D Models dialog box (see Align 3D Models Dialog Box). The Align 3D Models dialog box provides you with the ability to align the pads of a 3D model with the pads of a part decal, as displayed in the SailWind 3D window.

**Clearance Checking Features**

For checking clearances, the SailWind 3D window provides options:

- Manually check distances between a component and a point on the PCB or an assembly using the "Measure Distance" and "Measure Minimum Distance" features. This option is especially useful when aligning a 3D model with decal pads.
- Perform automatic design rule checking across the entire design through the use of 3D clearances Design Rule Checks (DRC).

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_2_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Note:**

Use the 3D Clearances dialog in the SailWind 3D window for defining your 3D clearances.

**MCAD Collaboration**

To aid in the collaboration effort with mechanical designers, the SailWind 3D window features the MCAD Collaborator, a tool for tracking and annotating design change proposals. With the MCAD Collaborator, you can establish an initial or "baseline" design with the mechanical designers. When you make a change from the baseline layout design (for instance, you move a part), the MCAD Collaborator lists the affected part as a change proposal and allows you to exchange the proposal with the mechanical design team as an *.idx* file. Upon acceptance from the mechanical designers, the proposal becomes the new baseline.

## SailWind 3D Object Manipulation
You can rotate the viewing angle of your PCB design in the SailWind 3D window along three axes. You can also zoom in or out to change the magnification of the rendered PCB design. Use the viewing controls in tandem with the SailWind 3D window display options to view various features of your PCB design.

**Rotating the View**

Choose the **View > SailWind 3D** menu item to open the SailWind 3D window. The window displays next to the SailWind Layout design window.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 39. The SailWind 3D Window**

You can resize the SailWind 3D window as necessary by dragging its border with the mouse.

The SailWind 3D window features a 3D view "cube" control for rotating, zooming, and panning the threedimensional PCB. Rotate the PCB in the SailWind 3D window to a fixed or orthogonal view (such as front view, top view, left-hand view, and so forth) by either clicking a corresponding surface of the cube, or by clicking a rotational arrow to rotate the PCB view in 90° increments.

**Note:** Clicking a cube surface also changes the view to the default magnification.

Click the "home" icon at the corner of the cube for an isometric view of the PCB.

Alternatively, you can rotate the PCB dynamically by clicking any surface of the cube control and rotating it in the desired direction. The PCB moves as you rotate the cube.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 40. Rotating the PCB with the 3D View Control**

**Zooming and Panning**

Use the 3D view control to zoom in on the PCB or pan across to view certain details as described in the following table:

| If you want to                      | Do the following                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom in or out of the current view. | Press the Ctrl key and drag the 3D view controller<br>up or down.        |
| Pan across the current view.        | Press the Shift key and drag the 3D view controller<br>in any direction. |

**Using the Middle Mouse Button**

Alternatively, if you want to rotate the board along a single axis or manipulate the 3D view from anywhere on the display using the middle mouse button, do so as follows:

| If you want to                      | Do the following                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom in or out of the current view. | Press the Ctrl key and rotate the middle mouse<br>wheel up or down. |

**Table 103. Manipulations with the Middle Mouse Button(continued)**

The SailWind 3D window supports most zooming functions available in the 2D workspace. For more information, see Zooming Overview.

**Tip** Rotation with this method is limited to one axis at a time. To rotate the PCB in a dynamic direction, use the 3D view control instead.

**Preset Views**

The SailWind 3D window provides preset views (View Top, View Bottom, View Front, View Back, View Left, and View Right) for rapid access to standard views. Access these preset views by clicking the

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_5_Figure_8.jpeg)

associated buttons in the 3D window toolbar.

While these preset views do not adjust the image magnification, they are useful for returning the view to an established angle, such as the top or front view.

## 3D Model Mapping
The SailWind 3D window allows you to assign a 3D model to a PCB component and align it with the decal pads. This alignment and assignment information is known as model *mapping*.

Mapping 3D models begins with assigning a 3D model to a component in the SailWind 3D window—see Assigning a 3D Model to a Component. After assigning and aligning the 3D model, you have the option of saving the mapping information to the Reuses folder location (for a netlist project).

When you map a 3D model to a component, and you choose to save the model mapping to the *Reuse*  folder location (using the Update Library Dialog Box), SailWind Layout associates the 3D model assignment with the part type. It also associates the 3D model alignment information to the decal.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

The mapping function allows you to re-use the 3D model with any other design that has the same part type and decal combination. For more information, see Reusing 3D Models with Other Components in a Design.

Update Library Dialog Box

## Assigning a 3D Model to a Component
Assign or "map" 3D models to component decals and align them so the SailWind 3D window accurately represents them in the rendered image. Import a new 3D model from an external source and map it to a decal then align the 3D model so that it is placed correctly on the PCB.

You can map 3D models in one of two ways: directly within the 3D window or within the Decal Editor.

Within the 3D window:

- You can perform mapping more quickly than editing in the Decal Editor and reloading the design in the 3D window after returning
- Changes do not modify the decal
- Changes apply to all components with the same part type-decal pairing
- You can make alignment changes in delta offset values only

Within the Decal Editor:

- You can apply a model mapping to multiple Part Types
- Changes modify the decal, possibly making it appear in the list in the Update from Library Dialog Box
- You can make alignment changes in absolute or delta offset values
- When exiting, you can choose to apply mapping to the selected component or to all components using the same part type-decal pairing

**Procedure**

1. Select a component in the SailWind 3D window.

If you select an ECO-registered component, ensure the it meets "certain requirements"on  page 531 so that it displays correctly in the SailWind 3D window.

2. Click the **Import Part Model** button on the 3D window toolbar. .

Alternatively, if you want to use the Decal Editor, perform the following steps:

a. Right-click on a component and click the **Edit decal** popup menu item.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_7_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

If your software license does not enable this feature, click in the standard twodimensional layout design view to access the **Edit decal** command.

The Decal Editor opens and displays the default two-dimensional decal of the component and a corresponding representation in the SailWind 3D window adjacent to it. The Align 3D Models Dialog Boxalso opens.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

b. In the Align 3D Models dialog box, select the part name (or names, if you want to map the same 3D model to more than one part) in the "Parts mapped to selected model" list and click **Import**.
3. In the Import Part Model dialog box, select the correct model definition file you want to import and click **Import**.

If you are assigning a 3D model through the Decal Editor, the new model appears in the Model Name list of the Align 3D Models dialog box as the model mapped to the decal.

4. Rotate or reposition the imported 3D model as necessary so it aligns correctly with the decal pads as follows:
	a. Rotate the model so it is oriented correctly over the pads (its pins do not need to be aligned yet —you will align them in the next sub-step).
	b. Click the **Align Pin-Pad Center** button. The decal pads hide temporarily to simplify alignment.
	c. Select a face on a model pin to use for alignment, adjusting the 3D view as necessary for access. For example, if you are aligning a SO-14 package, select the bottom surface of pin 1 that you expect to make contact with the pad.

The decal pads return to view after you select an alignment face.

d. Click the corresponding decal pad to which you want to align the center of the selected pin face. The model moves so the center of the pin face is aligned with the center of the pad.
e. In some cases—such as when you are mapping a through-hole component—you may also need to define which model face you want to make "seat" against the pad.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 42. Selecting a Model Face**

i. Click **Define Seating Plane**.
ii. Rotate the 3D view as required to access the model face you want to seat against the pad.
iii. Click the face to select it. The model adjusts to seat the face against the pad.

**Note:**

If you close the 3D Window before exiting the Decal Editor, the Decal Editor prompts you to save your data. Click **Yes** at the prompt to save the 3D model mapping and apply the 3D model to all parts in the design that have the decal. Otherwise, click **No** to abandon your changes.

5. Click **OK** when finished aligning and centering the model with the decal pads.

In the 3D window, you can save changes to the library using the Update Library Dialog Box. You can also use the Manage Mappings Dialog Boxto apply mappings to other components in the design.

After updating the library with your changes, you can later "change the 3D model"on page 532 associated with the component but you can no longer delete all model associations.

6. (Decal Editor only) Choose the **File> Exit Decal Editor** menu item when you are finished aligning the imported model.

In the Apply Decal Changes prompt, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design or **Selected** to apply the model to the selected component only.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** Click **All** if you change only the model alignment.

**Results**

The SailWind 3D window displays changes in the three-dimensional representation of your design and its components.

Saving 3D Models for Re-use in Other Designs

## Reusing 3D Models with Other Components in a Design
As a time-saving measure, you can reuse or reassign 3D models to components on the rendered PCB design that share a common physical footprint. For example, you can assign the 3D model from a surface mount resistor to a surface mount capacitor if the two components appear physically identical.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot use the Manage Mappings dialog box to reassign a 3D model to a part if the part is already saved in the library with a 3D model.

**Prerequisites**

You have already mapped the 3D model you want to reuse to at least one component.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **Manage Mappings** button.
2. Select the "Enable cross probing" check box in the Manage Mappings Dialog Box.
3. Click a component in the 3D window that has the 3D model you want to reuse and make note of the corresponding entry indicated in the "Parts mapped to models list" of the Manage Mappings dialog box.

| Parts mapped to models:         |               |                        |         |  |

## Holes in SailWind 3D
In some cases, you must add certain attributes to components if you want the holes to display properly in SailWind 3D.

Holes Displayed in the 3D Window Assigning a 3D Model to a Non-ECO Mounting Hole Rendering Mounting Holes on ECO-Registered Parts as Voids Setting Multi-Pin Components to Display Holes for Some Pins

### Holes Displayed in the 3D Window
Pin holes, mounting holes, and other component holes do not always render as voids in SailWind 3D. The display of holes depends on several factors, such as whether or not the component is an ECOregistered part or a non-ECO registered part, the number of pins, and whether or not it has a pin with a drill specification.

Generally, the pin holes of a component (such as a through-hole capacitor) always appear filled in SailWind 3D. For all other components, you must assign either the "HOLE" attribute or the "MountingHolePins" attribute for holes to display as voids.

The following sections summarize how holes render in SailWind 3D under various conditions.

**ECO-Registered Parts**

- Pin holes display as filled by default, even for through-hole components and components with only a single pin.
- Components with multiple pins that have mounting holes still render as filled.
- You can make the voids visible in SailWind 3D by applying either the ""HOLE" attribute"on page 531 or the ""MountingHolePins" attribute"on page 532.

**Non-ECO Registered Parts**

- Pin holes display as filled by default UNLESS the component has a single pin with a non-zero drill specification, in which case it converts automatically into a mounting hole and displays as such.
- SailWind 3D automatically renders a non-ECO component with a single pin as a mounting hole if the pin has a non-zero drill specification. This automatic rendering prevents you from selecting the mounting hole in the 3D window (to assign a 3D model to it, for example).

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_12_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:** A mounting hole generally displays as a hole in the board, nothing else.

• You can assign a 3D model, such as a standoff, to a non-ECO component if you first "apply the MountingHolePins attribute"on page 530. Assigning this attribute enables you to select the

component in the 3D window. Assigning the attribute also effectively converts the component from a mounting hole to a mechanical component with one mounting hole inside it.

**Note:**

SailWind 3D renders any non-ECO registered part with the "MountingHolePins" attribute as a mechanical component if the part has only a single pin (such as is the case for a mounting hole or fiducial). Be aware that turning off the display of mechanical models in the SailWind 3D settings hides such parts. Also be aware that these parts export as mechanical parts when exporting the design to MCAD software.

### Assigning a 3D Model to a Non-ECO Mounting Hole
In some cases, you may want to assign a 3D model, such as a standoff, to one or more board mounting holes. You can assign a 3D model after first applying the "MountingHolePins" attribute.

**Procedure**

1. In the 2D workspace, right-click the mounting hole then click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, select the component level from the "Attributes for" list.
3. Click **Add**.
4. In the new Attribute box, type, "MountingHolePins" and press the Enter key.
5. (Optional) If you want the hole to continue to display as a void, type the pin number in the Value box.
6. Close the Object Attributes dialog box.
7. In the 3D window, select the corresponding mounting hole (note that it now displays as filled unless you specified the pin number in the Value box). Apply and "assign a new part model"on page 523.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_13_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Figure 44. 3D Mounting Hole Before and After Applying the Attribute**

### Rendering Mounting Holes on ECO-Registered Parts as Voids
In some cases, ECO-registered parts may not appear correctly in the SailWind 3D window; specifically, if a part is a single pin part, you must add certain attributes to the part decal to ensure a correct appearance.

**Procedure**

1. Right-click the component in either the 2D workspace or the 3D window, then click the **Attribute**  popup menu item.
2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, click **Add**.
3. Type one of the following attributes:

| Pin Type     | Attribute |
|--------------|-----------|
| Through-hole | HOLE      |
| SMD          | FIDUCIAL  |

**Table 104. Required Attributes**

For a single-pin, through-hole part, adding the "HOLE" attribute displays the hole as a void in the SailWind 3D window. For SMD single-pin parts, add the "FIDUCIAL" attribute in cases where you want the part treated as a fiducial.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_14_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 45. ECO-Registered Mounting Hole Before and After Applying the HOLE Attribute**

### Setting Multi-Pin Components to Display Holes for Some Pins
You can set attributes on an ECO-registered part so that the holes associated with one or more selected pins render in SailWind 3D as voids.

**Procedure**

1. Right-click the component in either the 2D workspace or the 3D window, then click the **Attribute**  popup menu item.
2. In the "Object Attributes dialog box"on page 1496, click **Add**.
3. Type "MountingHolePins" as the new attribute name and press the Enter key. In the Value box, type the pin number for each pin in the component where you want the corresponding hole to display as a void. Ensure you separate each pin number with either a comma or a space (for example, "P001,P003,P005," and so on).

**Note:** Keep the following in mind

- Ensure you specify the pin number of the part, NOT the decal pin number
- If you specify all pin numbers for an ECO-registered part, SailWind 3D renders the part as a mechanical model. Be aware that these parts export as mechanical parts when exporting the design to MCAD software.
- The software takes longer to render the 3D image of your PCB the more pin numbers you specify for hole rendering.

**Figure 46. Mounting Pin Holes Before and After Applying the Attribute**

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_15_Picture_13.jpeg)

## Changing a 3D Model Assignment
You can change or assign a different 3D model to a component decal.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Mapping through the Decal Editor allows you to choose to apply changes to only a component instance, if desired. Mapping in the 3D window applies changes to all instances of a component.
- If you have already updated the library with a 3D model assignment, you can change the assigned 3D model but you cannot remove all 3D model associations from the component.
- Be aware that any mapping changes made in the Decal Editor—including assignment and alignment of 3D models—affect the decal timestamp, which may affect the schematic during backward annotation.
- In the 3D window, you can use the Manage Mappings Dialog Boxto apply mappings to other components in the design.

**Procedure**

1. Select the part to which you want to assign a different 3D model.
2. Click the **Import Part Model** button on the 3D window toolbar. .

Alternatively, if you want to use the Decal Editor, perform the following steps:

a. Right-click on a component and click the **Edit decal** popup menu item.

The Decal Editor opens and displays the component decal and its currently mapped 3D model.

b. In the Align 3D Models Dialog Box, select the part or parts in the "Parts mapped to selected model list" that you want to reassign then click **Import**.
3. In the Import Part Model dialog box, browse to and select the correct model definition file you want to import and click **Import**.

If a dialog box appears with a caution about rewriting a file, click **Yes** to overwrite the model currently in the local design library, **No** to import the file as a new model, or **Cancel** to exit without making changes.

4. "Rotate or reposition"on page 525 the imported 3D model as necessary so it aligns correctly with the decal pads; then click **OK**.
5. (Decal Editor only) Choose the **File> Exit Decal Editor** menu item when you are finished aligning the imported model.

In the Apply Decal Changes prompt, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design or **Selected** to apply the model to the selected part only.

The new 3D model appears in the Model Name list of the Align 3D models dialog box as the model mapped to the decal.

6. In the "Apply Decal Changes" dialog box, click **All** to apply the 3D model to all parts using the decal in the design.
7. If you previously saved the model mapping to the Reuses file location, you can update the mapping:
a. Click the **Update Library** button in the SailWind 3D window toolbar.
b. In the Update Library Dialog Box, select the check box of the part with the new mapping.
c. In the Overwrite policy list, choose "Overwrite all in Library."

## Importing and Aligning 3D Mechanical Models
Add mechanical designs such as mounting brackets to your PCB design in the SailWind 3D window to examine clearances and construction with the rest of the PCB. Adding 3D mechanical designs helps to ensure the PCB parts fit with the mounting hardware or enclosures in the final, packaged PCB assembly.

You can import mechanical designs in a wide variety of file formats, including *.asat*, *.iges*, *.sat*, *.step* (*.stp*), and *.xtda*.

**Prerequisites**

• You have opened a design in SailWind Layout and you have also opened the SailWind 3D window.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **Mechanical Model Properties** button .
2. In the Mechanical Model Properties Dialog Box, click the **Add** button ; then browse to and select the mechanical model file and click **Open**.

**Tip** You can also import a mechanical model from the SailWind 3D window by clicking the

**Import Mechanical Model** button .You can then modify its properties by selecting the model and clicking the **Mechanical Model Properties** button.

The imported mechanical model appears in the SailWind 3D window and a temporary instance name appears in the **Instance** dropdown list.

3. Rename the mechanical model by typing a more descriptive name in the **Instance** dropdown list.
4. Select a model type to determine which 3D clearance rules to apply and where to display the model in the 3D Display Control settings (see 3D Display Control Window).
5. Rotate and align the 3D mechanical model to its proper position in relation to the PCB design using the Rotate and Offset controls. Alternatively, select the Allow interactive mechanical model movement check box to reposition the mechanical model by dragging it with the mouse. Rotate the PCB angle as required to align the mechanical model in the X, Y, and Z direction. See SailWind 3D  Object Manipulation.
6. Select or clear the check boxes for your save options.
7. Close the dialog box and save the PCB design when you are through adding the mechanical model.

**Results**

You have added and aligned a mechanical model to your 3D PCB layout. If necessary, you can use the commands on the mating toolbar to ensure an accurate fit between mechanical models. For more information, see Positioning 3D Mechanical Models Using Mating Commands.

## Positioning 3D Mechanical Models Using Mating Commands
You can use the mating commands (on the 3D window Toolbar) to accurately mate the surface of an imported 3D mechanical model with another surface. Two mated surfaces connect physically and remain in contact. Attempts to manipulate movement of one mated model is thus limited to permit only movement that keeps the mated surfaces in contact.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:**

The mating commands apply to mechanical models only. To move or manipulate components, use the Decal Editor.

**Prerequisites**

You have already imported a 3D mechanical model and rotated or aligned it roughly in the position where you want to place it.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click to choose the mechanical model that you want to mate.
2. On the 3D window toolbar, click the **Mate Selected Models** button.
3. On the mechanical model, click the surface, edge, or other feature (such as a hole) that you want to mate to another surface.

To aid in choosing the feature, right-click and click a popup menu item to limit feature selection to the type of feature you want to align:

- **Snap to Closest**  Enables you to click any mechanical feature of the model, whether it is an axis, edge, or face.
- **Snap to Axes**  Enables you to click the discernible X, Y, or Z axis of a feature on the model, such as a hole, cutout, or corner.
- **Snap to Edges**  Enables you to click any edge of the mechanical model.
- **Snap to Faces**  Enables you to click one of the non-edge surfaces of the mechanical model.

SailWind Layout highlights the chosen feature after you click it.

4. Click a corresponding surface or mechanical feature on the other model where you want the mechanical model to mate. For example, if you choose a standoff on the mechanical model, and you want to mate it to a mounting hole on the PCB, click the desired mounting hole on the PCB.

The mechanical model moves or snaps to the selected mechanical feature. In addition, in the Mechanical Model Properties Dialog Box, the alignment and movement features become disabled. SailWind Layout permits only movements that allow the two mated surfaces to remain in contact.

5. To disassociate or "unmate" the two surfaces at any time, click the mechanical model again to choose it and click the **UnMate selected models** button.

If you want to unmate all models at one time (without having to choose them all first), click the **UnMate all models** button.

## Creating a Board Outline From an Imported Mechanical Model
You can import a mechanical model into the SailWind 3D window for use as a physical board outline in your design. If you want to use any of the holes already in the mechanical model, you must map them to their proper type, such as cutouts or mounting holes, to ensure proper import.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_19_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Note:**

If you re-create a board outline using the same mechanical model, SailWind Layout discards your previous hole mappings.

**Prerequisites**

You have imported the mechanical model that you want to use for your board outline.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window toolbar, click the **Create Board Outline** button.
2. Select the surface of the imported mechanical model that you want to use for the board outline.
3. Click the location on the mechanical model that you want to use as the origin of the board outline.
4. A list of holes already in the imported mechanical model appears in the Map Hole Features Dialog Box. Select each hole that you want to use for the board by clicking the Hole Type box and choosing the corresponding hole type from the dropdown list:
	- <Discard> The default setting. The software ignores holes set to "Discard" when it generates the board outline.
	- Contour Indicates the hole is a cutout.
	- MountingHole Indicates the hole as a board mounting hole. Choose this option only if you want to map a hole in the mechanical model to an existing hole in your PCB design. If you choose this hole type, click the Hole Attribute box and select the corresponding mounting hole attribute from the dropdown list.

You can clear the Highlight check box for each hole individually to make identification easier. The SailWind 3D window centers a hole on the display if you select its check box again. Alternatively, you can click any hole on the mechanical assembly to cross probe with the holes in the dialog box. 5. Click **OK**. The Map Hole Features dialog box closes and the design updates with the new board outline.

The updated board outline appears in both the SailWind 3D window and the layout design view.

## Creation of 2.5D Models
SailWind Layout creates a "2.5D" model automatically by combining a component's outline (such as that used for silkscreen) with its Geometry.Height attribute. When you open the SailWind 3D window, any part that does not already have a 3D model assigned is represented by a 2.5D outline. The component outline must meet certain requirements to ensure proper generation of the 2.5D model.

**Component Outline Hierarchy**

SailWind Layout locates component outlines using a layer hierarchy:

1. Layer defined in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file
2. Layer 25 (125)
3. Top associated assembly layer
4. Top layer
5. <All Layers>
6. Layer 20 (120)

To define a component outline layer in the SailWindpcb.ini file, open the file (at *<drive>\<install\_folder> \<release>\Settings\SailWindpcb.ini*) with a text editor and add the following line:

3D\_Shape\_Layer = <layer number>

Where <layer number> is the component outline layer.

**Component Outline Requirements**

Component outlines must be closed in order for SailWind Layout to generate a 2.5D model. If you place any open component outlines on a layer defined in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file, for example, SailWind Layout disregards the open outlines and selects only those that are closed.

To ensure SailWind Layout generates 2.5D models for all components, create closed component outlines and place them on Layer 25. SailWind Layout locates the closed component outlines as it searches through the component outline hierarchy. For example, if you have open silkscreen outlines for a component on the top layer—and the top layer is defined as the component outline layer in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file—ensure you add corresponding closed outlines of the component to Layer 25.

Compare 3D and 2.5D Models

## Compare 3D and 2.5D Models
As an additional aid for laying out parts on your PCB, you can view the "2.5D" models in tandem with 3D parts in the SailWind 3D window. Enabling the 2.5D view allows you to check the alignment and positioning of a 3D model in relation to the original 2D layout to verify you have mapped the correct model.

The "2.5D" model is an extrusion of the decal's silkscreen outline and the Geometry.Height attribute. When you open the SailWind 3D window, any part that does not already have a 3D model assigned is represented by a 2.5D outline of its decal. Any 3D model you assign to a part replaces the 2.5D model.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 48. A 2.5D Model Replaced by a 3D Model**

As a layout verification, you can turn on the 2.5D model after assigning a 3D model by selecting the Overlay 3D Models with 2.5D check box in the 3D Display Control Window. The correctly aligned 3D model overlays the 2.5D outline.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

Reposition or realign the 3D model as necessary to reconcile any significant placement differences between the 2.5D and 3D models. If the models are not the same shape, ensure you have mapped the correct 3D model to the part.

See "Comparing 2D Components with 3D Models"on page 541 for instructions.

2. Examine the design and identify any components that may have alignment or positioning

**Tip** To better evaluate the alignments, rotate the 3D image or change the view settings as needed. If necessary, clear the Perspective check box in the 3D Display Control dialog box so you can see the alignments and positions more clearly.

3. Correct any problems by adjusting the alignment of the 3D models so they are positioned correctly relative to the 2D components and land patterns.

## Saving 3D Models for Re-use in Other Designs
You can save 3D ("map") model-to-decal alignments from one PCB design and re-use them in an existing design wherever the part types and decal names are the same. For example, if you have two PCB designs that share a specific IC with an SO-16 decal, mapping a 3D model to the IC in one PCB design allows you to use the same 3D model with the IC/decal combination in the other PCB design. SailWind

Layout saves your 3D model mappings to the Reuses file location specified in the **Tools > Options> Global> File Locations** tab.

**Prerequisites**

- You are viewing a PCB design in the SailWind 3D window.
- You have mapped at least one 3D model to a decal in the PCB design.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the Update Library button.
2. In the Update Library Dialog Box, select the 3D model mappings that you want to save. Mappings are listed in the dialog box according to the part and decals to which they are mapped.

Select the Enable cross probing check box if you want the ability to click on a part in the design to interactively locate its corresponding mapping in the list.

3. Select an overwrite policy from the Overwrite policy list.
4. Click **Apply** to save the 3D model mapping or mappings to the Reuse file location.
5. Click **OK** to close the message prompt.
6. Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

**Results**

You have mapped 3D models to part types in the Reuse file location and you have saved the 3D model alignment information with the part decals. The 3D models automatically appear in other designs wherever the part and decal combination is the same. If changes occur to any of the mapped 3D models externally to the PCB design, you can import the changes by clicking the **Update Models** button in the

SailWind 3D window.

## Component Placement in the SailWind 3D Window
As an additional tool for PCB layout, you can use the SailWind 3D window for component placement. Using the SailWind 3D window allows you to check the component placement in three dimensions.

After you import a design, SailWind Layout initially places all the design components on the PCB origin. With the SailWind 3D window, you can disperse the components and place them around the PCB as you would in the standard two-dimensional design view. The SailWind 3D window supports many of the standard component placement functions through use of a context menu.

For example, you can spin, rotate, nudge, disperse, and move components to the PCB flip side from withing the SailWind 3D window by right-clicking on a component and selecting an option from the popup menu. For more information about component placement, see "Part Placement"on page 471.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

Use the standard two-dimensional design view to route and connect your components; the SailWind 3D window does not support component routing.

As with the two-dimensional design view, you can use on-line Design Rule Checking (DRC) to alert you to clearance warnings or violations while placing components in the SailWind 3D window. See "Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D" on page 545 for instructions.

## Synchronizing the Design and SailWind 3D Viewing Areas
Set options to enable the views in the Design space and the SailWind 3D window to mirror one another in zoom level and pan area.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window with nothing selected, right-click and click the **3D Display Control**  popup menu item, or on the 3D General toolbar, click the **3D Display Control** button.
2. In the "3D Display Control Window"on page 1034, in the Options section:
	- Select the Drive 2D View check box to send synchronization commands to the Design view. Zoom levels and pan moves made in SailWind 3D will be matched in the Design space.
	- Select the Follow 2D View check box to receive synchronization commands from the Design view. Zoom levels and pan moves made in the Design space will be matched in SailWind 3D.
3. Click **OK**.

## Defining 3D Clearance Constraints
Define 3D clearance X,Y, and Z axis constraints for the objects in SailWind 3D. You can define generic, mechanical model type, and component specific constraints.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• 3D clearance constraints affect only models in SailWind 3D and do not conflict with or override design constraints.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, on the 3D General toolbar, click the **Clearances** button .
- 
2. In the 3D Clearances Dialog Box, to add a new row, click the **Add** button .
3. In the new row, click the From and To fields to choose objects from the lists.
4. Type values where needed in the Minimum XY, Minimum Z, Optimal XY, and Optimal Z boxes. If there are blank values the clearance is not checked. For example, this allows you to omit the XY clearance for a connector sticking out past the board edge. Specify a blank XY value for the specific component to board edge constraint.
5. Repeat as necessary.
6. Click **OK**.
7. For the next step, see either "Running Batch 3D Clearance Checking"on page 546 to check all design objects or "Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D" on page 545 to view clearance violations as you move objects.

## Viewing DRC Violations in SailWind 3D
Enabling standard on-line Design Rule Checking (DRC) in the **Tools > Options** menu also allows you to view 3D clearance violations in the SailWind 3D window while you position components on the PCB.

You can define your 3D clearances using the 3D Clearances Dialog Box.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

DRC in the SailWind 3D window checks only the 3D clearances; they do not conflict with or override design constraints.

**Prerequisites**

You have already defined one or more 3D clearances for your project (see "Defining 3D Clearance Constraints"on page 544).

**Procedure**

1. Enable on-line DRC in either the "Prevent Errors" or "Warn Errors" mode—see "Design Rule Checking"on page 410.
2. Position your PCB components as required. While positioning your a component, the component changes color (you may have to hold to component with the cursor at a position and allow it to "hover" a moment) to indicate 3D clearance violations as follows:
- **Optimal XY or Optimal Z violations**  Affected components or surfaces highlight in yellow when placement exceeds any "optimal" clearance.
- **Minimum XY or Minimum Z violations**  Affected components or surfaces highlight in red when placement exceeds any minimum clearance.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_29_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 50. 3D Optimal and Minimum Violation Examples**

3. Reposition the affected component as required until the highlight disappears, indicating the 3D clearance is no longer exceeded.

## Running Batch 3D Clearance Checking
Check all 3D objects against the 3D Clearances constraints.

**Prerequisites**

• 3D Clearances must be defined. For more information, see "Defining 3D Clearance Constraints"  on page 544.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, on the 3D General toolbar, click the **3D Design Rule Check** button

. A Processing dialog box opens displaying the elapsed time for the process. Then a window opens displaying the number of hazards found and showing a path to the log file.

2. In the Output Window, click the link to view the contents of the log file.

## Changing the Appearance of Components and Models in 3D
You can alter the appearance of components and assemblies in the SailWind 3D window to make it quicker to identify key groups or components. For example, you can color code all 3D models of high frequency parts to make grouping them easier prior to routing. You can also make components transparent to view details beneath them.

**Procedure**

1. Open the 3D Display Control Window.
2. Select a component or mechanical model using one of the following methods:
	- Click on a component or mechanical model on the PCB in the SailWind 3D window; then in the appropriate Components, Assemblies, Mechanicals, or PCBs area of the 3D Display Control dialog, click **Add selected** to add it to the list.
	- If the component does not appear in the list, click **Add** and select it.
3. Locate the component in the appropriate list (Assemblies, Components, Mechanicals, or PCBs) of the 3D Display Control dialog box and select its corresponding Appearance checkbox. Ensure the Appearance check box is selected for the component or assembly and make the following changes are desired:
	- Assign a color from the Color palette and set the transparency to the desired level.
	- Clear the corresponding Visibility check box to hide a component or assembly.
4. Click **Apply** after making your changes.
- <span id="page-30-1"></span>5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box when you are done.

## Measuring In 3D with Measure Distance
Measure distances between features of the 3D models when working in the SailWind 3D window.

3D Display Control Window

## Viewing Internal Layers in SailWind 3D
The SailWind 3D window provides a virtual preview of the final manufactured PCB, allowing you to see into the layer stackup and inspect internal routing, via connections, and other design factors not visible in the 2D view.

Use the SailWind 3D window to analyze how blind and buried vias are connected through the layer stackup on a routed design. By scaling the design and zooming into areas of dense routing, you can verify that via connections on internal layers meet design specifications. Manipulating or rotating the design in the SailWind 3D window may also help you identify regions in high density designs where you can improve the placement or routing (see "SailWind 3D Object Manipulation"on page 519).

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, open the 3D Display Control Window.
2. Select the "Include Internal Layers" check box to view the traces and pads on the internal layers.

3. In the Options section, select the "Z-Axis Scaling" check box and choose a value for the Scale Factor from the dropdown list. (The larger the scaling value, the wider or "thicker" the gap between layers becomes in the Z-

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_35_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** Selecting the Z-Axis Scaling check box also displays via barrels in the inner layers that are not otherwise visible when selecting the "Include Internal Layers" check box alone.

4. Use the 3D view controls to orient the design in the SailWind 3D window and focus on a specific area you want to analyze.
5. Visually examine the critical traces and vias to determine if the inner layer structures meet the design requirements. Note that the SailWind 3D window measuring tools (Measure Distance and Measure Minimum Distance) continue to report true material measurements regardless of z-axis scaling.

If necessary, you can select the Copper Planes check box (in the Objects area) to view internal layer copper planes. Ensure you click **Refresh** after selecting the Copper Planes check box to ensure the copper planes are visible.

## Creating 3D Cross Sections
Create cross-sectional "cutaway" views in the SailWind 3D window to view details such as the fit between the PCB components and mechanical assemblies or enclosures.

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_36_Figure_2.jpeg)

Creating a cross sectional view allows you to access components, vias, traces, and other details hidden by enclosures or other objects.

**Procedure**

1. In the SailWind 3D window, click the **X Cut Plane**, **Y Cut Plane**, or **Z Cut Plane** button, depending upon which direction you want to "cut."

You can click one, two, or all three cut plane buttons and have more than one active cut plane at one time (though only one cut per plane type).

2. When the cut plane appears, drag the cut plane to the location where you want it and rotate it as necessary to achieve the desired cutaway view. The 3D cut plane removes all 3D material to one

![](/layout/guide/22/_page_37_Figure_2.jpeg)

side from view.

3. Click the cut plane button again to remove the cut plane.

The cut plane returns to its original pre-defined starting location the next time you click its corresponding button.

## Checking the Status of the 3D Design
As you make changes in the SailWind 3D window, you may lose track of the parameters you have set and how the design is currently configured. You can generate a report of the 3D statistics and verify that the 3D design is acceptable.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Design Status** button on the 3D General Toolbar.

A 3D Design Status Report file appears.

2. Review the contents of the report file to verify the 3D parameters.

| Status Parameter | Description                                                           |

|                        | Note:<br>The beginning value of the range shows a negative<br>number if models are mounted on the rear of the<br>PCB.                                                              |
|                        | The Design Z Extents range tells you the overall<br>thickness so you can verify that you have not exceeded<br>the overall thickness (height) restriction for the<br>assembled PCB. |
| Parts Models Found     | Lists the 3D model assignments for each part in the<br>design.                                                                                                                     |
|                        | Review this list to verify that you have the correct model<br>assignment for each part.                                                                                            |
| Parts Models Not Found | Lists all parts that do not have a 3D model assignment.<br>By default, these parts are represented by 2D extruded<br>models.                                                       |
|                        | To assure the greatest accuracy possible in the 3D View,<br>assign 3D models to all of the parts in this list when<br>possible.                                                    |
| Assemblies             | Lists the mechanical assemblies that you have imported<br>into the design.                                                                                                         |
|                        | Review this list to verify that you have imported all of the<br>correct assemblies in the design.                                                                                  |

3. (Optional) Make any changes necessary. For example, change model assignments, assign 3D models to parts that do not have model assignments, or change the Z-axis clearances to accommodate height restrictions for the design. After making the changes, generate a new 3D Design Status Report and review it again.

**Tip** Use the 3D rotate, pan, and zoom controls to orient the design in the SailWind 3D window the way you want it to appear in the exported image.

2. On the 3D General Toolbar, click the **Export** button.
3. In the Export dialog box, choose the directory path, type the file name, and in the "Type" dropdown list, choose SAT (*.sat*) or STEP (*.step*) as the file type.
4. In the "Mechanical Model Options" area, determine the type of design objects you want to export by selecting either "All mechanical models" (any mechanical models you have added plus the board with the components) or "Include with board export items only" (just the models with the "Include with board export" check box selected in the Properties dialog box).
5. Select the check box for each element type you want to export.
	- The Silkscreen and Soldermask check boxes apply to STEP file export only.
	- You can choose to export element types in separate files by selecting the "Export as Sheets" check box. For more information, see Export Dialog Box.
6. Click **Save**.

**Results**

SailWind Layout saves the specified mechanical models as one or more files, depending on your export selections. Note that if you export certain mechanical model elements as individual sheets (files), and

later you clear one or more of the element type check boxes in the Export dialog box, SailWind Layout deletes the corresponding SAT or STEP file.
