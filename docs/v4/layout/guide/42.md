## OLE in SailWind Layout
With SailWind Layout object embedding capabilities you can insert other files or other applications as linked or embedded objects within a SailWind Layout design. Linked objects automatically update from the source each time you open the SailWind Layout database.

For example you can insert a Microsoft Word document containing manufacturing information or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing a Bill of Materials. SailWind Layout does not need to understand the format of the inserted object; SailWind Layout communicates with the application that created the file and that source application tells SailWind Layout what information to display and how to display it.

Insertion of SailWind Logic, Layout or Router files as OLE objects in other files (including other PADS files) is not supported. Any SailWind Logic, Layout or Router file inserted in another file will not behave properly and cannot be edited within the "container" application.

## Inserting OLE Objects in SailWind Layout
You can insert a linked or embedded object into your design.

**Note:**

If you have multiple OLE objects in a SailWind Layout design, you can export them to an .ole file on page 293 and import them into other designs.

**Tip**

If you insert an object whose source application is an OLE linking and embedding server, that application opens inside SailWind Layout, but runs in the background. The source application's toolbar takes over the SailWind Layout toolbar. You can then work with the source application in the same way as you would if you started it outside of SailWind Layout. This is called visual editing. When you click outside of the object, the SailWind Layout toolbar takes over again, and you can continue to design in SailWind Layout. Because the source application continues to run in the background you can click on the object and work in the source application at any time.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Insertion of SailWind Logic, Layout or Router files as OLE objects in other files (including other PADS files) is not supported.
- You cannot insert OLE linked or embedded objects in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Insert New Object** menu item. The Insert Object dialog box appears.
- 2. Click whether to Create New or Create from File. Create New inserts a new OLE object. Create from File inserts an existing file as an OLE object.
- 3. If you clicked Create New, click the type of OLE object you want to create. If you clicked Create from File, click the file you want to insert as an OLE object.
- 4. If you clicked Create from File, and you want to make the inserted object a link to the original file, select the Link check box. If you choose not to link the object, it is an embedded object.
- 5. If you want to display the object as an icon, select the Display as Icon check box.
- 6. Click **OK** to insert the object in SailWind Layout.

Object Linking and Embedding

## Embedded Text Documents
You can embed a multi-line text document in your design instead of using the Text tool on the Drafting Toolbar to add multiple single lines of text. After the file is embedded, you can resize the object appropriately.

For instructions, see "Inserting OLE Objects in SailWind Layout".

For this purpose, embedding is recommended over linking since the embedded document will reside inside the *.pcb* file and cannot get lost or accidentally deleted, as an external file can. You can see a sample of an embedded text file in the *preview.pcb* sample design. See the Notes section below the board outline. Double-click the text to activate the Microsoft Word document.

Please note the following restrictions:

- OLE objects cannot be plotted by a pen or photo plotter. They can only be printed.
- Plot OLE objects must be enabled in the Plot Options Dialog Boxto appear in the printout, but they will never be visible when viewing the Print Preview.
- OLE objects can be printed only by using a zero plot orientation.

## OLE Object Selection
Selection of OLE objects in SailWind Layout operates differently than selection of other objects such as pads, nets, components and so forth.

The differences are:

- You cannot select more than one OLE object at a time.
- You cannot use area select to select OLE objects.
- Commands apply to selected OLE objects only, even if you also select SailWind Layout objects. OLE objects have selection priority over SailWind Layout components.
- OLE objects are always on top; to select SailWind Layout items under an OLE object, you must move the OLE object.

When you click on an OLE object in SailWind Layout, it behaves like a nontext item in a Word file. that is, it becomes a rectangular area with sizing handles to indicate that it is selected. (Sizing handles are small, black squares that appear at the corners and along the sides of a rectangular area surrounding a selected object.)

Right-click a selected OLE object to access a shortcut menu that lists all commands that you can apply to the OLE object.

## OLE Object Management
Managing OLE objects is similar to managing SailWind Layout objects. You can cut, copy, and paste OLE objects using the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands from the Edit menu.

Undo and Redo do not affect OLE objects, so use care when managing them.

Cutting, Copying, and Pasting an OLE Object Toggling the Background Color of an OLE Object Toggling Display of OLE Objects Toggling an OLE Object's Display Type Moving an OLE Object Resizing an OLE Object Converting an OLE Object Specifying an OLE Object's Activation Type Deleting OLE Objects

### Cutting, Copying, and Pasting an OLE Object
You can cut or copy a linked or embedded object, and paste it.

**Procedure**

- 1. Copy or cut the OLE object as follows:
	- a. Select the OLE object.
	- b. Click **Edit menu> Copy** or **Edit menu> Cut**.
- 2. Click the **Edit> Paste** menu item.
- 3. Relocate the pasted object as necessary.

### Toggling the Background Color of an OLE Object
You can toggle the background color of an OLE object between the design background color and white.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the OLE object.
- 2. Right-click, and click the **White Background** popup menu item.

### Toggling Display of OLE Objects
If you have many linked or embedded objects in your design, you can increase redraw speed by turning off OLE object display.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > .**Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the OLE Document Server area, select the "Display OLE Objects" check box.

**Toggling an OLE Object's Display Type**

You can toggle an object's display type between display as icon and display as the actual object.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the OLE object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **(Object\_Type) > Convert** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Convert Dialog Box, click the Display as Icon check box.

### Moving an OLE Object
Move OLE objects just as you move non-text objects in a Word document.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click and hold the left mouse button on the object.
- 2. Drag the object to the new location, and release the mouse button.

### Resizing an OLE Object
You can resize OLE objects by dragging any of the sizing handles.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object.
- 2. Click and drag one of the sizing handles to resize the object. Sizing handles are small, black squares that appear at the corners and along the sides of a rectangular area surrounding a selected object.
- 3. Release the mouse button when the object is sized correctly.

### Converting an OLE Object
You can convert an embedded OLE object to another object type. The types of object you can convert the OLE object to depends on the object's source application.

**Tip**

Tip: You can also specify that an object remain as it is, but be activated as an object of a different type. See Specifying an OLE Object's Activation Type.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **(Object\_Type) > Convert** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Convert Dialog Box, click **Convert to**, and select the type to convert to from the Object Type list.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Specifying an OLE Object's Activation Type**

You can specify that an embedded object remain as it is, but be activated as an object of a different type. The types of object you can activate the OLE object as depends on the object's source application.

![](/layout/guide/42/_page_5_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** Tip: You can also convert an object to a different type. See Converting an OLE Object.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **(Object\_Type) > Convert** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Convert Dialog Box, click **Activate as**, and select the type to activate the object as from the Object Type list.
- 4. Click **OK**.

### Deleting OLE Objects
You can delete a single OLE object with the Delete key, or all of them using a special menu item.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Undo and Redo do not affect OLE objects, so use care when managing them.

**Procedure**

- 1. If you want to delete all OLE objects in the design, click the **Edit> Delete All OLE Objects** menu item.
- 2. Otherwise, select the single OLE object to delete.
- 3. Press the Delete key.

## Editing OLE Links
You can edit the link of a linked OLE object. Editing the link allows you to update the link, open the original object source, change the original object source, or break the link with the object source to make an embedded OLE object. You can also choose to update the object automatically or using a manual command.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Links** menu item. The Links dialog box appears.
- 2. Click the link you want to edit from the list.
- 3. Click the options you want to use or modify.
- 4. Click **Close** to close the Links dialog box. You cannot cancel changes you make in the Links dialog box.

## Open an OLE Object for Viewing or Editing
You can edit an OLE object's content within SailWind Layout (known as in-place editing), or in a separate window. In either case, you edit its contents as you normally would using all of the source application's commands and tools.

See the documentation for the source application for more information on displaying, selecting, deleting, and saving SailWind Layout objects in container applications.

Viewing or Editing In Place in SailWind Layout Viewing or Editing in a Separate Window

### Viewing or Editing In Place in SailWind Layout
You can use an OLE object's source application within SailWind Layout to view or edit the object.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Linked objects cannot be edited in place: they open in a separate window for viewing or editing.
- If the source application does not support viewing/editing within SailWind Layout, the object opens in a separate window.

**Procedure**

- 1. Double-click on the object.
- 2. Make the appropriate edits.
- 3. When you are finished editing, click outside of the object to end the edit session.

**Results**

<span id="page-7-2"></span>Updates are automatically reflected in the object.

### Viewing or Editing in a Separate Window
You can edit an OLE object outside SailWind Layout, in the source application.

**Procedure**

- 1. Ensure that the Update on Redraw check box in the Global tabon page 1531 of the Options dialog box is checked.
- 2. Ctrl+double-click on the object.
- 3. Make the appropriate edits in the source application window.
- 4. When you are finished editing, click **File> Close and Return to** <design\_file\_name>. (This is the form of the command in MS Word. In other applications the command may be slightly different.)

**Results**

<span id="page-8-0"></span>Updates are automatically reflected in the object.

## Saving OLE Objects
OLE objects are automatically saved as part of your design when you save a SailWind Layout design.

If you want to save OLE objects separately, use Exporton page 293 to save all the OLE objects in an *.ole*  file. You can then use Importon page 287 to import them into other designs.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item.
- 2. Click OLE Files (\*.ole) from the Save as Type list.
- 3. Browse to the location for the new OLE file.
- 4. Type a name for the file.
- 5. Click **Save**.
