Creating a New PCB Design by Manually Importing the SailWind Logic Netlist Troubleshooting the Netlist Process Dispersing Components by Schematic Sheet Cross Probe with SailWind Logic Forward-Annotation of Design Changes from SailWind Logic Backward Annotation from SailWind Layout to SailWind Logic

## Creating a New PCB Design by Manually Importing the SailWind Logic Netlist
Use this method if you do not have both SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout on your computer. This manual method requires you to manually export the netlist from SailWind Logic and then import it into SailWind Layout.

Alternatively, if you have both SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout on your computer, use the SailWind Layout Link within SailWind Logic for a simpler method. For more information, see Creating a New PCB Design Using the Automated SailWind Layout Link in the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

**CAUTION:** Forward annotation of changes to an existing design requires a different process. See "Forward-Annotation of Design Changes from SailWind Logic".

**Prerequisites**

This is a continuation of a process started in SailWind Logic. You must have the netlist (*\*.asc*) file. For more information, see "Manual Netlist Process Between SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout" in the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

**Procedure**

1. In SailWind Layout, click the **File> Import** menu item.
2. Select "ASCII Files (\*.asc)" in the file type list.
3. Navigate to the location of the netlist file created from the SailWind Logic design, select it, and click Open.

**Results**

The import process sources all the part types and decals from the library and stacks the decals at the origin. You can then click the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to spread out the components. Alternatively, you can arrange parts based on the schematic sheet.

If an errors report file (*ascii.err*) is generated and errors are found in the netlist, see "Troubleshooting the Netlist Process" for more information.

## Troubleshooting the Netlist Process
If SailWind Layout finds errors in the netlist import process, it generates an errors report file (*ascii.err*) and displays the error report file in a Notepad window. SailWind Layout does not generate an errors file if it does not find any errors.

The following are errors that are reported and steps to perform in fixing those errors:

- Library issues
- Single or zero pin nets
- Totally floating connections or subnets
- Unnamed dangling connections (one end floating)
- Power and Ground symbols used on nets whose name is different from the default name on the symbol
- Multiple subnet nets where one or more subnets is missing an off-page symbol
- Single subnet nets with an off-page symbol (lonely subnet warning)
- User named subnets that have no visible net name label

**Procedure**

1. In SailWind Layout, click the **File> New** menu item.
2. Click **No** when you are prompted to save the design.
3. Add any missing components listed in the *ascii.err* file to your library, either by adding a library which contains the missing components to your library list, or by creating the missing part types and decals. (For instructions, see "Adding Libraries to the Library List"on page 144, "Creating and Modifying Part Types", and "Creating and Editing PCB Decals".)
4. Resolve any other errors found in the *ascii.err* file.
5. When all the errors have been resolved, repeat the procedure you used to pass the netlist from SailWind Logic to SailWind Layout.

## Dispersing Components by Schematic Sheet
After receiving netlist from SailWind Logic, you can use the "Disperse by Logic" feature to disperse components while retaining their relative positions almost as indicated in the schematic sheet. You can also specify what action to take and perform on the components to disperse.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have the netlist (*\*.asc*) file passed from SailWind Logic to SailWind Layout, and all the errors in the *ascii.err* file resolved.
- Netlists to use with this feature must be generated by SailWind Logic in versions later than V3.0.34.

**Procedure**

1. With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Disperse by Logic** popup menu item.
2. In the "Disperse by Logic" dialog box, specify the dispersing strategy, with details described below.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |

## Cross Probe with SailWind Logic
You can control cross probing with SailWind Logic by using the SailWind Layout Link within SailWind Logic.

For instructions, see "Cross-Probe Between SailWind Products" in the *SailWind Logic Guide.*

## Forward-Annotation of Design Changes from SailWind Logic
You can import design changes from SailWind Logic into SailWind Layout. Create the ECO file containing the design changes by comparing the schematic and the layout design. You can then bring forward design changes from the SailWind Logic design using one of three methods.

**Tip** If you are creating a new PCB by importing a netlist for the first time, see "Creating a New PCB  Design by Manually Importing the SailWind Logic Netlist"on page 271.

**CAUTION:**

Design changes resulting from forward-annotating can cause existing "electrical nets" to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether. It can also cause existing electrical nets to be extended or new electrical nets to be created if the refdes prefixes of updated components are specified in the Electrical Nets dialog box. For more information, see "Electrical Nets"on page 337.

If you have both SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout on your computer, use the "SailWind Layout Link" in SailWind Logic for the simplest and fastest automated process. For more information, see Forward Annotating Using the Automated SailWind Layout Linkin the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

If you do not have SailWind Logic on your computer, you must compare the schematic and layout designs in either SailWind Logic or SailWind Layout to generate an *.eco* file to apply to the layout design. Using the Compare/ECO tool in SailWind Layout requires less steps since it can also automatically import the differences of the generated *.eco* file.

Forward Annotating Using an ECO File Generated by SailWind Layout Forward Annotating by Importing an ECO File from SailWind Logic

### Forward Annotating Using an ECO File Generated by SailWind Layout
SailWind Logic provides you with updated netlist file that you can compare the current PCB layout to generate an *.eco* file. You can then import the file to update the PCB layout.

This procedure is a continuation of the procedure Method 2 — Generate the ECO File in SailWind Layout in the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_4_Picture_13.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Design changes resulting from forward-annotating can cause existing electrical nets to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether. It can also cause existing electrical nets to be extended or new electrical nets to be created if the refdes prefixes of updated components are specified in the Electrical Nets dialog box. For more information, see "Electrical Nets"on page 337.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- During design comparison, a reuse definition is ignored and actual elements in the physical design reuse are used in the comparison.
- Transferring non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts is constrained. See the override settings in the Design categoryof the SailWind Logic, Options dialog box.

**Prerequisites**

You must have an updated schematic netlist (*.asc*) file, and have the PCB design open in SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

1. There is no undo after an *.eco* file import. If you think you might want to revert to the state of the design before the import, you should save a copy of the PCB layout.
2. In SailWind Layout click the **Tools > Compare/ECO** menu item.
3. In the Compare/ECO dialog box, click the Documents tabon page 1185.
4. In the "Original Design to Compare and Update" area, select the "Use Current PCB Design" check box. If the check box is unavailable, clear the check box of the same name in the "New Design with Changes" area.
5. In the New Design with Changes area, browse for the updated schematic netlist (*.asc*) file. You will need to change the file type to "ASCII Files (\*.asc)".
6. Click the Comparison tabon page 1181, and select the options you want to use for design comparison.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_5_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** To avoid unexpected changes during forward annotation, consider comparing data before you forward-annotate. Select only the Generate Differences Report check box in the **Documents** tab, and click **Run**. The netlist and PCB files are compared and differences written to *Layout.rep* in the *\SailWind Projects* folder. To see the differences, click **Show Report** in the Process Status dialog box.

7. On the **Documents** tab, select the Generate ECO File check box, and verify the ECO Filename. Give the file a unique name to avoid overwriting any existing ECO files.
8. Click the Update tabon page 1187, and select the Update Original Design check box. This saves you from manually importing the generated ECO file.
9. Set the other options for updating.
10. Click **Run**. The Process Status Dialog Boxopens. Output files are written to the *\SailWind Projects* folder. Messages or errors that occur during comparison are also written to *Layout\_Session.log*  and *Layout.err* in the *\SailWind Projects* folder.

**Results**

The files generated are:

- *<pcb\_name>mine.eco*  The ECO file. Contains ECO commands that describe the changes needed to update the original design to match the new design. Generated when you select the Generate ECO File check box in the Compare/ECO Tools dialog box, **Documents** tab. For more information, see "ECO File Commands" in the *SailWind Layout Command Reference*.
- *Layout.rep*  The Differences Report file. Describes the differences between the "old" and the "new" compared files. Generated when you select the Generate Differences Report check box from the Compare/ECO Tools dialog box, **Documents** tab. For more information, see "Differences Report" on page 848.
- *ecogtmp0.asc*  Temporary copy of the "old" netlist
- *ecogtmp1.asc*  Temporary copy of the "new" netlist
- *ecogtmp[ 0|1 ].err*  Generated only if errors are found in the netlist. A link to this file is displayed in the Output Window.

### Forward Annotating by Importing an ECO File from SailWind Logic
You import the *.eco* file of design changes into SailWind Layout.

For more information, see Method 3 — Generate the ECO File in SailWind Logicin the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

**CAUTION:**

Design changes resulting from forward-annotating can cause existing electrical nets to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether. It can also cause existing electrical nets to be extended or new electrical nets to be created if the refdes prefixes of updated components are specified in the Electrical Nets dialog box. For more information, see "Electrical Nets"on page 337.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- During design comparison, a reuse definition is ignored and actual elements in the physical design reuse are used in the comparison.
- Transferring non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts is constrained. See the override settings in the Design categoryof the SailWind Logic, Options dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_6_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** As long as the PCB design has not undergone engineering changes, the last *.asc* file from SailWind Logic can be compared to the current design in SailWind Logic to generate the *.eco* file of the engineering changes in the design. If the last exported *.asc* file is lost, you can export anon page 291 *.asc* file from SailWind Layout to compare against the current schematic to generate the *.eco* file that gets imported into SailWind Layout to update the PCB layout. The same effect is created using "Forward Annotating Using an ECO File  Generated by SailWind Layout" but with that method, the process is semi-automated by automatically importing the *.eco* file.

**Prerequisites**

You must acquire an *.eco* file, and have the PCB design open in SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

1. There is no undo after an *.eco* file import. If you think you might want to revert to the state of the design before the import, you should save a copy of the PCB layout.
2. Click the **File> Import** menu item.
3. On the File Import dialog box, select the "ECO Files (\*.eco)" file type.
4. Browse to the file to import and click **Open**.

**Results**

If there are errors during the import, an *eco.err* file opens in your default text editor. No changes are made to the PCB layout until the *.eco* file is imported without errors. A link to the ECO Import errors file is also written to the Output window.

## Backward Annotation from SailWind Layout to SailWind Logic
Using the process called *backward annotation*, you can export your PCB layout changes "back" to the schematic. You can send part, gate, pin, net, and attribute changes.

**CAUTION:**

While there are three methods to backward annotate design changes, only one method is recommended — Back Annotating Using an ECO File from SailWind Layout. The other methods generate an *.eco* file by design comparison - a less accurate process. The recommended method records the *.eco* file in SailWind Layout while making ECO changes and manually imports it into SailWind Logic for the best results. For more information, see "Recording Versus Generating an ECO File"on page 814.

### Back Annotating Using the Automated SailWind Layout Link
If SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout reside on the same computer, you can use the SailWind Layout Link dialog box to compare a newer PCB design with an older schematic, and update the older schematic from the newer PCB design. You can also create a differences report.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Transferring non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts is constrained. See Options Dialog Box, Design Categoryfor details.

During design comparison, a reuse definition is ignored and actual elements in the physical design reuse are used in the comparison.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_8_Picture_11.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

This method generates a new *.eco* file and does not use a recorded *.eco* file. Recording the exact changes in an *.eco* file gives the best back annotation results. Use Back Annotating Using an ECO File from SailWind Layoutfor the best results. For more information, see "Recording Versus Generating an ECO File"on page 814.

**Prerequisites**

You must have the older schematic open in SailWind Logic, and the newer PCB design open in SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

1. In SailWind Logic, click the **Tools > SailWind Layout** menu item.
2. If SailWind Layout is not already open with the design, the Connect to SailWind Layout dialog box appears.
	a. Click **Open** to open the PCB design you want to annotate from in SailWind Layout.
	b. In the File Open dialog box, select the *.pcb* file and click **Open**.
3. In the SailWind Layout Link dialog box, click the Design tab.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** To avoid unexpected changes during backward annotation, consider comparing data before you back-annotate. If you want to check the design differences before updating, click the **Compare PCB** button. The two versions are compared and differences written to *Logic.rep* in the *\SailWind Projects* folder. To see the report, click the *logic.rep* link in the Output Window.

4. On the Preferences tab, set the appropriate options.
5. On the ECO Names tab, set the appropriate options.
6. On the Design tab:
	a. If needed, select the "Compare Design Rules" and "Show Net List errors report" check boxes.
	b. Click the **ECO From PCB** button.

**Results**

If you receive a message that the schematic net list may have errors, you should not continue, but select the Show Net List errors report check box and run ECO From PCB again to investigate and fix the errors before you proceed.

### Back Annotating Using an ECO File from SailWind Layout
Create the *.eco* file of design changes using SailWind Layout and then import it into the SailWind Logic design.

Recording engineering changes to your design is the preferred means of generating the *.eco* file since it creates a perfect "before-and-after" record of changes. You can generate an *.eco* file by comparing designs; however, it does not create a perfect before-and-after record of components that are exactly identical in their part types and connections. For more information, see"Recording Versus Generating an ECO File"on page 814.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Transferring non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts is constrained. see "Options Dialog Box, Design Category" for details.
- During design comparison, a reuse definition is ignored and actual elements in the physical design reuse are used in the comparison.

**Prerequisites**

If you neglected to record the *.eco* changes and you must generate the *.eco* file by comparing two designs, see "Comparing Two Versions of a Design".

**Procedure**

1. Record the engineering/netlist changes in an *.eco* file. For more details, see"Recording ECO Changeson page 814".
2. In SailWind Logic, click the **Tools > Options** menu item. In the Options Dialog box, click the **Design** category.
3. Set the "Allow overwriting of attribute values in design with blank values from library" check box appropriately to allow or prevent overwriting of non-blank attribute values with blank ("placeholder") values from the library.
4. Click **OK**.
5. In SailWind Logic, with your design open, click the **File> Import** menu item.
6. In the File Import dialog box, in the file type list, select "ECO Files (\*.eco)".
7. Browse for and select the ECO file to import.

**8. Click Open.**

**Results**

If no errors occur, the schematic is updated. If errors occur, the schematic is not updated, and the errors, along with a link to the ECO Import errors file (*eco.err*), are written to the Output window.

### Back Annotating Using an ECO File Created in SailWind Logic
You can acquire the layout design in an *.asc* file format and compare it to the schematic design with the SailWind Logic Compare/ECO tools. You can then import *.eco* file of design changes into the SailWind Logic schematic design.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Transferring non-ECO-registered parts and non-electrical parts is constrained. see "Options Dialog Box, Design Category" for details.
- During design comparison, a reuse definition is ignored and actual elements in the physical design reuse are used in the comparison.

![](/layout/guide/12/_page_11_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

This method generates a new *.eco* file and does not use a recorded *.eco* file. Recording the exact changes in an *.eco* file gives the best back annotation results. Use "Back Annotating Using an ECO File from SailWind Layout" for the best results. For more information, see "Recording Versus Generating an ECO File" on page 814.

**Prerequisites**

You must have an *.asc* file exported from SailWind Layout. For more details, see "Exporting an ASCII File on page 291".

**Procedure**

1. In SailWind Logic, click the **Tools > Options** menu item. In the Options dialog box, click the **Design** category.
2. Set the "Allow overwriting of attribute values in design with blank values from library" check box appropriately to allow or prevent overwriting of non-blank attribute values with blank ("placeholder") values from the library.
3. Click **OK**.
4. In SailWind Logic, click the **Tools > Compare/ECO** menu item.
5. In the Compare/ECO dialog box, click the Documents Tab.
6. In the Original Design to Compare and Update area, select the Use Current Schematic Design check box. If it is unavailable, you will first need to clear the check box of the same name in the New Schematic Design with Changes area.
7. In the New Schematic Design with Changes area, browse for the new *.asc* file exported from SailWind Layout. In the New Design File Name dialog box, change the file type to "ASCII Files (\*.asc)" to locate your file.
8. Click the Comparison Tab, and select the options you want to use for design comparison.
9. Optionally, if you want to check the design differences before creating the ECO file:
	a. Select the Generate Differences Report check box in the **Documents** tab.
	b. Clear the Generate ECO File check box.
	c. Click**Run**. The netlist and PCB files are compared and differences written to *Logic.rep* in the *\SailWind Projects* folder. Click **Show Report** in the Process Status dialog box to view the differences.
10. Select the Generate ECO File check box, and verify the ECO Filename. Give the file a unique name to avoid overwriting any existing ECO files.
11. Click **Run**. Output files are written to the *\SailWind Projects* folder. Messages or errors that occur during comparison are also written to *Logic\_Session.log* and *Logic.err* in the *\SailWind Projects* folder.
12. In SailWind Logic, click the **File> Import** menu item.
13. In the File Import dialog box, in the file type list, click "ECO Files (\*.eco)".
14. Browse for and select the ECO file to import.
15. Click *Open*.

**Results**

If no errors occur, the schematic is updated. If errors occur, the schematic is not updated, and the errors, along with a link to the ECO Import errors file (*eco.err*), are written to the Output window. You must correct the errors before you can import the file.

Backward Annotation Results

### Backward Annotation Results
The backward annotation process handles various layout changes differently while back-annotating to the schematic.

**Attribute Level Backward Annotation**

You can backward annotate new attributes and deleted attributes.

**New Attributes**

- A new attribute in a part updates all parts of the same type. If the attribute name does not exist, it is added with the assigned value.
- An error is created if the part does not exist.
- Unsupported attribute types, such as net or net class, are ignored.

**Deleted Attributes**

- Deleting an attribute for a part-type deletes the attribute on all parts of that type in the design.
- An error message is generated if the part or attribute name does not exist.
- If the attribute command specifies an object type not supported for general attributes, such as net or net class, the attribute command is ignored.

**Part Level Backward Annotation**

You can backward annotate added parts, changed parts, deleted parts, and the reference designator name.

**Added Parts**

- A new sheet is created and all new parts are added to the sheet. Parts are placed on a grid so that parts of a medium size do not overlap. No attempt is made to avoid overlapping of larger parts.
- An error message is generated if the reference designator of the newly added part already exists or if the part does not exist in the Library.
- The part is not added to the schematic if the reference designator already exists.
- If the part contains Signal Pins, these pins are included in the add pin function. Backward annotation does not currently support signal pins so an error message is created.

**Changed Parts**

- If the changed part is a multi-gate part, all gates are updated to the new part type.
- An error message is generated if the new part does not exist in the design or in the Library, or if the gate or pin count is incompatible.

**Deleted Parts**

- If the deleted part is a multi-gate part, all gates are deleted.
- An error message is generated if the part is still connected to a net or the part does not exist.

**Reference Designator Name**

• If the part being renamed is a multi-gate part, all gates are updated. An error message is generated if the old reference designator does not exist.

**Gate Level Backward Annotation**

You can backward annotate swapped gates.

• SailWind Logic creates an offpage symbol at each swapped gate. An error message is created if the gate does not exist.

**Net Level Backward Annotation**

You can backward annotate joined nets, nets created by splitting an existing net, and renamed nets.

**Joined Nets**

• The first net is renamed to be the same name as the second net.

**Nets Created by Splitting an Existing Net**

• A Delete Pin from Net operation is performed to remove them from the existing net, followed by an Add Pin to Net operation to add the pin to the new net.

**Renamed Nets**

- All subnets of the old net on all sheets are renamed. If any of the subnets contain Power or Ground symbols without netnames, netnames are added to these symbols.
- An error message is created if the new net already exists.

**Pin Level Backward Annotation**

You can backward annotate swapped pins, pins added to a net, and pins disconnected from a net.

**Swapped Pins**

• SailWind Logic creates an offpage symbol at each swapped pin.

**Pins Added to a Net**

- A pin can be added only if it is not already connected to another net. If the pin is a gate pin (a visible terminal pin on the gate symbol), an offpage symbol is created.
- An error is created if pin is already connected or the pin is a signal pin already assigned to a net.

**Pins Disconnected from a Net**

- If the pin is a gate pin, the connection is deleted if it connects to a tie-dot or offpage symbol. If the connection goes to another gate pin, the connection is broken and, an offpage symbol is added.
- This command generates an error message if the pin is not connected to the net in question.
