## Routing Setup Considerations
Consider certain SailWind Layout setup options before you begin routing your design.

**Angle Modes**

Angle modes constrain the trace angle as you route the design and also impact the entry into pads. All routing modes are subject to the angle constraints for pad entry that you set in the Line/Trace area in the Design category of the Options dialog boxon page 1503. As shown in the table below, the routing modes are Orthogonal, Diagonal, and Any Angle. The modes determine how a trace follows the cursor from corner to corner and enters a pad on completion. To set these modes quickly type the AO, AD, or AA modeless commandson page 83. All angle modes are constrained by the grid size if "Snap to grid" is enabled for the "Design grid" in the Grids optionson page 1537. The Status dialog boxon page 1733 is a useful tool for easy access to toggling the Snap to grid feature.

| Mode            | Description                                                      |  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Orthogonal (AO) | Prevents you from entering diagonal lines and 45-degree corners. |  |
| Diagonal (AD)   | Limits you to 45- and 90-degree angles on the grid.              |  |
| Any Angle (AA)  | Allows placing routes at any angle.                              |  |

**Table 111. Angle Modes**

**Starting Layer for Routing**

To set the current routing layer before you start routing, select the layer from the Layer list on the Standard Toolbar. A layer's current Routing Direction setting appears next to its entry in the Layer list. When you select a connection and select a routing mode, the route begins on that layer.

When you end a route on a layer different from where you began it, the layer you ended on becomes the active layer and appears in the Layer list. The next connection you select starts on this active layer. You can set a different active layer by using the list or by using the L modeless commandon page 83: type L; type the Layer number, and press the Enter key.

### Via Types
A via is a drilled and plated hole used to connect copper objects on different layers of a printed circuit board.

In general, there are two types of vias:

- **Through-hole vias**  Vias that are drilled through every layer of the board.
- **Partial vias**  Vias drilled through a select number of layers. Partial vias include:
	- **Blind vias**  Vias that pass through an outer layer and connect to an inner layer.
	- **Buried vias**  A partial via that passes through only the inner layers.

Vias have a variety of uses in a layout design:

- **In Routing**  The most common use for vias is in routing traces, to continue the connectivity of traces to other layers. When you add a via during routing, SailWind Layout connects it to the trace and considers it a routing via.
- **In stitching and shielding**  Vias used aside from routing are sometimes called free vias because they can be added anywhere in the design.

Free vias are more often called stitching vias because when added to a design, they may resemble a row or pattern of stitches. In addition, they are often used to "stitch together" copper to a plane. For example, you might add vias to a small copper area to give it more numerous connections to a ground plane, insuring a solid connection.

When you add these vias, the Stitching property is enabled, which distinguishes them from routing vias.

There are several methods you can use to place stitching vias in a layout design:

- Add single vias repetitively. Vias appear on your cursor, ready to be placed. For instructions, see "Adding [Stitching](#page-67-0) Vias".
- Surround a net, pin-pair, or copper area with vias to act as a via shield (**Add Via Shield** command). For example, you might place a via shield around a pin-pair to create an RF trough. For instructions, see ["Adding](#page-75-0) a Via Shield".
- Stitch a copper or copper hatch shape with a pattern of vias (**Via Stitch** command). There are two modes for stitching the patterns:
	- You can fill the shape with vias. For instructions, see "Filling a Shape with a Pattern of Vias".
	- You can also add vias inside the perimeter of the shape. For instructions, see "Placing Vias Inside the Perimeter of a Shape".

**Via Modes**

Use the Vias Dialog Box to determine what kind of via to install when you change levels while routing. Use the V modeless commandon page 83 to open the dialog box.

The table below lists the via routing modes. To set the via type quickly, use the VA, VP, or VT modeless commandson page 83.

| Mode           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Automatic (VA) | SailWind Layout chooses from all vias, through or partial, that can<br>handle the particular layer change. If SailWind Layout finds partial vias<br>dedicated to the layer change, it chooses from them even if the via is<br>not one that is specifically selected in the Vias dialog box. If SailWind<br>Layout cannot find a dedicated partial via, it selects any through vias<br>for a through or partial layer change. It then checks the Routing Rules<br>Dialog Boxfor vias that are allowed for the net you are routing. If more<br>than one via still passes, SailWind Layout installs the one with the<br>smallest drill diameter or smallest pad size. Automatic allows only vias |

**Table 112. Via Routing Modes**

| Mode         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |

**Table 112. Via Routing Modes (continued)**

In any case, the via must not create a clearance violation according to the default clearance rules or the clearance rules attached to the net you are routing, whichever rule takes precedence. If On-line DRC is set to Prevent Errors, the layer will not change if the trace or via creates a clearance problem.

You can change an installed via to another type using the Via Properties Dialog Box. For more information, see the "Modifying Via [Properties"](#page-79-0) topic. You can also change the via type during routing. For more information, see the ["Changing](#page-48-0) the Via Type While Routing" topic.

**Allow Vias by Net**

Use the Routing Rules Dialog Boxto control which vias are eligible for which nets. This is one of the main criteria for the automatic via selection.

**Trace Width**

You can pass a value for trace width with the netname from the schematic. You can also enter or edit the width as a line in the schematic ASCII file for nets. If widths are assigned to nets when the netlist is read in, the connections automatically assume those widths when routing. If no widths are associated, SailWind Layout provides a default width of 12 mils for all nets. You can change the default trace width at any time by changing the Recommended Trace Width. For more information, see the Clearance Rules Dialog Box.

The recommended width is in effect unless you override it locally. For example, a net may have a width of 12 assigned to it, but you need a certain pin pair within the net to have a width of 10. Use the Pin Pair Properties Dialog Box to assign a local trace width to the pin pair in the Trace Width box.

You can see a connection's assigned width when you select it. The width appears on the Status Dialog Box on page 1733prefixed with "W:" between the pin pair and the trace-to-trace clearance.

If you have the Advanced Rules license option, you can assign different widths within a net by making the width assignments on the net class, pin pair, or group of pin pairs level.

**Length Minimization**

When you start interactive routing, the flightline to the terminating pin may jump from the pin to which it is connected to another pin. This on-the-fly length minimization shows that the pin indicated by the flightline is part of the same net and is closer to the cursor than the original terminating pin.

You can disable length minimization by setting the topology type to "protected." In this case, the flightline appears but maintains its original connection. You can set this property for Net, Class, or the Default level of the rules hierarchy. For more information, see the Routing Rules Dialog Box.

**Routing Colors**

Use the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box to set different colors for routed traces on different layers. You can also set different colors for copper and for pads on pins or vias per level. If "Active layer comes to front" is selected on the Global category > General subcategory of the Options dialog boxon page 1531, when you start a routing command on that layer, all the traces drawn in the color for the current layer come forward and overlap traces on other layers.

To selectively hide or display traces or connections or to display nets with specific colors, use the View Nets Dialog Box. For more information, see "[Assigning Colors to Nets](#page-20-1)".

**Display of Trace Width**

To speed scrolling, panning, and screen regeneration, you can set a minimum displayed width for all lines. Any line widths under this width value appear as 1-pixel centerlines.

You can set the "Minimum display width" in the Global category> General subcategory of the Options dialog boxon page 1531 or use the R modeless commandon page 83. Set the value to your narrowest line width or less to see the design's true widths.

## Route and Unroute Protection
You can set options that prevent the modification of fully routed connections or the routed portion of partial routes, and also unroutes at the pin pair or net level. Protection of routed traces passes bidirectionally to and from SailWind Router to protect critically placed routes during interactive routing, and batch routing.

The protection setting is maintained when a reuse is created or broken apart. For more information, see the Breaking a Reusetopic.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_5_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip**

In the Routing category > General subcateoryon page 1542 of the Options dialog box, select the Show Protection check box to display traces with an outline pattern opposite that of other traces. In other words, if normal traces are solid, protected traces are outlined. If in Outline View Mode, protected traces are solid.

## Routing Tools
SailWind Layout provides multiple routing tools that each have their own special uses.

**Tip**

As an alternative, you can use the more powerful interactive and auto-routing capabilities of SailWind Router to route your design. Set up a routing strategy and options; indicate whether to autoroute with SailWind Router in the background or foreground. For more information, see Autoroute using SailWind Routeron page 776.

**Table 113. Routing Tools**

### Routing Manually
With the **Add Route** button on the Design Toolbar, click to indicate each corner in the trace. This type of routing works in any DRC mode.

You can add arcs, miters, and vias while a trace is in progress or after it is completed.

**Prerequisites**

- Set the routing directionon page 1441 for all layers.
- Set your gridson page 1537: design, via, and display.
- Set your design ruleson page 412 and enable DRCon page 461.

**Procedure**

1. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Add Route** button.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_9_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** You can set the Add Route command to start automatically when you double-click an unrouted path (connection). In the Options dialog box, Routing category > General subcategoryon page 1542, in the Unrouted path double click area, select the Add Route check box.

- 2. [Select an objecton page 698](#page-7-0) to route. The trace begins on the layer on which the object resides. If the object is on multiple layers, for example, a through-hole pin or via, the trace begins on the "active layer"on page 1808. When you start routing from a trace, a tackon page 1864 appears at the selection point.
- 3. Use the pointer to move the end of the trace you are drawing from grid point to grid point. The trace can move in one of the three Angle Modes: Orthogonal, Diagonal, or Any Angle. See the Line/Trace Angle setting in the "Options Dialog Box, Design Category."

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** As you route, the "guard band"on page 1832 appears whenever the head of the trace meets a clearance obstacle that it cannot shove. With design rules in prevent mode, you cannot complete the trace without changing the clearance rules or removing the obstacle.

- 4. Click to indicate a corner. To remove unwanted corners, press the Backspace key to remove the last corner and make the previous segment active.
- 5. Right-click and click the **Add via** popup menu item to change layers. For more information, see "Adding a Via While [Routing.](#page-46-0)"

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_9_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** Use Transparent Mode, T modeless commandon page 83, to view obstacles that may lie under traces on the active layer.

- 6. Proceed to your destination until you see the targeton page 1854 shape over a pad, trace, or via.
- 7. Click to complete the trace.

**Results**

If you disabled on-link design rule checking at any time when routing with the Add Route command, you should check the design for clearance violations. For instructions, see "Running a Design Check."

### Routing Dynamically
The Dynamic Route tool is an interactive autorouter that follows the direction of your pointer as you move it, seeking optimal paths and installing corners as the trace progresses. Dynamic Routing is available only in "Prevent errors" On-line DRC mode.

The Dynamic Route tool is a gridless, shape-based router. If the routing grid is set at less than clearance values, the Dynamic Route tool uses the clearance settings to decide the path.

Because corners install automatically, you quickly route a selected connection by pulling the head of the trace through obstacles with the cursor, guiding the path you want to use. Although you can, you do not have to manually install corners. Established traces move out of the way to make room for a path you are routing, providing there is room to move without creating clearance violations.

**Prerequisites**

- Set your design ruleson page 412
- Set the routing directionon page 1441 for all layers. Each layer has a preferred Routing Direction. Route on a layer that is set in the direction you need. For more information see "Layers Setup Dialog Box."
- Set your gridson page 1537: design, via, and display.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the drp modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to enable the online design rule checking Prevent mode and the **Dynamic Route** button. For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking"on page 461 and "Design Rule Checking."
- 2. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Dynamic Route** button.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_10_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** You can set Dynamic Route to start automatically when you double-click an unrouted path (connection). In the Routing Options > General subcategoryon page 1542, in the "Unrouted path double click" area, select the Dynamic Route check box.

- 3. [Select an objecton page 698](#page-7-0) to route. The trace begins on the layer on which the object resides. If the object is on multiple layers, for example, a through-hole pin or via, the trace begins on the "active layer"on page 1808. When you start routing from a trace, a tackon page 1864 appears at the selection point.
- 4. Guide the pointer through the items you want to bypass without creating corners. To remove unwanted corners, slowly move the pointer back over the unwanted traces. The trace can move in one of the three Angle Modes: Orthogonal, Diagonal, or Any Angle. See the Line/Trace Angle setting in the Options dialog box Design categoryon page 1503.

**Tip**

As you route, the guard bandon page 1832 appears whenever the head of the trace meets a clearance obstacle that it cannot shove. With design rules in prevent mode, you cannot complete the trace without changing the clearance rules or removing the obstacle.

- 5. Click to indicate a corner; these act as tacked corners to prevent preceding segments from moving. To remove unwanted corners that were placed by clicking, press the Backspace key to remove the last corner and make the previous segment active.
- 6. Right-click and click the **Add via** popup menu item to change layers. For more information, see "Adding a Via While [Routing.](#page-46-0)"

### Routing with the Single Layer Pin-to-Pin Autorouter
The Auto Route tools is a single layer, pin-to-pin autorouter that automatically adds traces to a selected connection or pin pair. Existing impeding traces are shoved when possible. Auto Routing is available only in "Prevent errors" On-line DRC mode.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- The auto router operates on one layer only; it will not add vias.
- The auto router follows only the current design grid.
- Each layer has a preferred routing direction, the auto router works only in the preferred routing direction. For more information, see "Layers Setup Dialog Box".

**Prerequisites**

Set your gridson page 1537: design and display.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the drp modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to enable the online design rule checking Prevent mode and the **Auto Route** button. For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking" and "Design Rule Checking".
- 2. To improve route completion results, click the **Tools > Length Minimization** menu item. The Auto Route tool follows the unrouted connections to add traces. If you run Length Minimization, you can provide shorter and more direct paths for the Auto Route tool to follow.
- 3. On the Design Toolbar, click **Auto Route**.
- 4. [Select an objecton page 698](#page-7-0) to route.

**Results**

The router makes three attempts to find a path, shoving existing traces in the process to create new channels for the route. If the router can't complete the route, the routine aborts and it leaves the unrouted connection.

### Bus Router
The bus router is a dynamic routing tool that creates buses. Use the bus router to quickly route data lines, memory arrays, or similar connections where several routes need to flow together from one part to another or to a set of parts.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_12_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** You need the Dynamic Route Editing (DRE) license option to use the bus router.

To use the bus router, identify multiple pin pairs to route and then place one route. This route acts as a guide route. The other routes, called follow routes, are based on the established path of the guide route. The bus router creates the guide route using the same automatic corner creation and trace shoving as the Dynamic Route tool.

To take full advantage of the bus router's automatic routing features, make sure selected pin pairs are adjacent to each other at both ends of the connection and that connections do not cross. Selecting pins with connections that cross each other invokes a manual bus route mode where you dynamically route each connection in sequence. For more information, see the [Routing Buses](#page-16-0)topic.

**Selection Criteria for Bus Routing**

The bus router creates routes from selected pins, vias, and tacks. You can set the Selection Filter to select only these objects. You can also right-click and click the Select Pins/Vias/Tacks popup menu item when nothing in the work area is selected. The bus router does not work if you select connections or traces.

While selected pins are the most commonly used objects for bus routing, adding selected vias and tacks lets you route a portion of a bus, end it, and then begin routing again.

**Selection Rules**

The following rules govern selection for bus routing:

- Select at least two objects. This can be a combination of pins, vias, and tacks.
- Selected pins can have through-hole or surface mount pads. Selected surface mount pads must exist on the same layer.
- Selected pins must all belong to the same part.
- Selected objects must have assigned nets.
- Nets to which the selected objects are assigned cannot be assigned to a plane layer.
- Selected vias or tacks must be attached to a dangling route.

**Object Filtering**

When you start the bus router, the following are automatically cleared:

- Pin selections on multiple parts. The part with the most selected pins remains selected and pins belonging to other parts are deselected.
- If two or more parts have the same number of selected pins, the part added to the design is chosen.
- Pins assigned to a plane net.
- One of two objects if they belong to the same net.

**Bus Route and the Active Layer Setting**

When you select surface mount pads or tacks at the ends of a trace, the layer on which these objects exist is detected and the layer is automatically set as the active routing layer.

**Tip** If a selected pin has a layer restriction on the active layer, it is deselected.

**Bus Route Tips for Adding Corners**

While bus routing, you can cycle through all of the connections in the bus to use a different connection for the guide route.

- Keep guide routes as short as possible Long guide routes can be difficult for the bus router to resolve, so indicate corners for bus turns as often as possible. If a Bus Route failure message appears on the status bar, press the Backspace key to undo the bus to the last indicated position. Then insert the corner at a different location.
- Switch the guide properly Proper control of the guide route is necessary for successful bus routing. The guide route should be internal when you indicate a corner. If you use an external guide route to create a corner, the internal follow routes shrink to make a turn, as long as there is sufficient space.

**Via Pattern Mode**

You can choose from five via patterns when you add vias to a bus. The chosen via pattern is used until you choose a different pattern or exit the program. The available via patterns are:

**Parallel**

Vias are added in a column, parallel to the direction in which the bus is traveling. Parallel is the default via pattern [\(Figure 91](#page-14-0)). If the guide route is one of the middle routes, the remaining routes adjust on either side of the pattern [\(Figure 92](#page-14-1)).

**Figure 93. Routing when Via Pattern is Perpendicular to Bus Direction**

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Staggered**

Vias are added in staggered rows to minimize space requirements. If the guide route is one of the middle routes, the remaining routes adjust on either side of the pattern [\(Figure 94\)](#page-15-0).

**Minus 45 Degrees**

<span id="page-15-1"></span>Vias are added in a diagonal, at a negative 45-degree angle to the direction in which the bus is traveling. If the guide route is one of the middle routes, the remaining routes adjust on either side of the pattern [\(Figure 95\)](#page-15-1).

### Routing Buses
The Bus Route tool is a dynamic router that creates data lines, memory arrays, or similar connections where several routes need to flow together from one set of parts to another. Bus Routing is available only in "Prevent errors" On-line DRC mode.

**Prerequisites**

- Set your gridson page 1537: design, via, and display.
- Set the routing directionon page 1441 for all layers. Each layer has a preferred routing direction, be sure to route on a layer that is set in the direction you need. For more information, see "Layers Setup Dialog Box".
- Set your design ruleson page 412.

**Procedure**

1. Type the drp modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to enable the online design rule checking Prevent mode and the **Bus Route** button. For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking" and "Design Rule Checking"on page 410.

**CAUTION:**

If the Smooth bus route traces optionon page 1542 is enabled, the Smoothon page 1860 command is applied to all Bus Route traces once they are complete.

**2. Design Toolbar button > Bus Route button.**

You can also activate the bus route mode from the shortcut menu or the toolbar after you have selected the objects for routing in the design.

3. Select multiple objects to route by holding the mouse button down and dragging a selection rectangle around them.

For example, draw a selection rectangle around a group of pins whose connections terminate on the same component. A route segment for the first connection, or guide routeon page 1832, attaches to the pointer (and follows pointer movement).

4. To use a different connection for the guide route, right-click and click the **Next Guide** (or **Previous Guide**) popup menu item to cycle through all of the connections.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_16_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** For a list of all Bus Routing keyboard shortcuts see the "Keyboard Shortcuts for Routing Operationson page 100" table.

5. As you move the pointer, you route in a dynamic route mode where corners are added automatically. The trace can move in one of the three Angle Modes: Orthogonal, Diagonal, or Any Angle. For more information, see the Line/Trace Angle setting in the Options dialog box > Design subcategoryon page 1503.

**Tip**

For best results, click to lock down a corner and use the inside connection as the guide since the guide does not take into account space required by the follow routes to turn around obstacles. After you indicate a corner, the guide route is reattached to the pointer.

6. To add a corner to the guide route only, right-click and click **Add Corner to Guide** (or Alt+Click).

The follow routes follow the guide route after you indicate the next corner. The other bus connections, or follow routeson page 1829, are routed following the guide route's path only after you add a corner or a via, end a trace, or complete the connection. If the bus router cannot create follow routes automatically, it switches to a manual bus route mode where you create each corner interactively. The bus router analyzes the new route and routes the other connections if possible, or it returns to manual mode. In manual mode, entering corners is the same as when you [route dynamicallyon page 700](#page-9-0). When you complete a connection in manual mode, the next connection becomes the new guide route.

The follow routes pattern is based on the direction of the last segment added for the guide route. For example, if the last guide route segment is horizontal, then all follow routes are added as horizontal with a vertical set of end points.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_17_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** The spacing of the routes is constrained by trace to trace clearances and snaps to the Design grid regardless of the snap to grid setting. You can vary the results of the bus routes by changing the grid spacing. For example, set the x and y coordinates of the grid to zero and then try 10.

- 7. To change layers for all connections at once:
	- a. Right-click, point to the **Via Pattern Mode** popup menu item, then click the pattern you want.
	- b. Move the pointer to where you want to add the via pattern.
	- c. Right-click and click the **Add Vias** popup menu item.

If DRC violations are detected, the message "Bus Router failed. Add vias for the current connection manually" appears on the Status Bar. Try Add Vias again allowing more room for the via placement using the current pattern. Otherwise, proceed to the next step to add the vias one at a time.

The spacing between vias is based on the via size, the via grid, and the widths and clearances of the traces.

d. If the via pattern you just added is not quite right, you can right-click and click **Cycle Via Pattern** to see if a different pattern will improve placement of the vias.

Patterns that do not fit into the current area are skipped and next pattern is used. The Cycle Via Pattern menu item is only available if Add Vias or Add Via to Guide was the last command used. For more information, see "Via [Pattern](#page-12-0) Mode [on page 703](#page-12-0)."

8. If Add Vias failed, change the layers one connection at a time:

- a. Move the pointer to where you want to add the via.
- b. Right-click and click the **Add Via to Guide** popup menu item. A via is added to the current guide route and the next connection becomes the new guide route.

The spacing between vias is based on the via size, the via grid, and the widths and clearances of the traces. For more information, see "Adding a Via While [Routing.](#page-46-0)"

- 9. To end the trace short of the target (leaving a dangling connection, or ending at a via or testpoint):
	- a. Right-click, point to the **End Via Mode** popup menu item, and then click an End mode. For more information, see "End Via [Mode](#page-27-0)."
	- b. Move the pointer to where you want to add the tack or via.
	- c. Right-click and click the **End** popup menu item.

If DRC violations are detected, the message "Bus Router failed. End bus manually" appears on the Status Bar. Try ending the bus again allowing more room. Otherwise right-click and click the **End Guide** popup menu item to end the routes individually.

The spacing between vias is based on the via size, the via grid, and the widths and clearances of the traces.

- 10. To complete the bus route, proceed to the final destination and do one of the following:
	- Right-click and click the **Complete** popup menu item (or double-click).
	- To incrementally complete each connection in the bus, move the guide route to its final connection point and click. The pointer changes to a targeton page 1854 shape at the correct connection point. The next connection in the bus becomes the new guide route. Repeat this process until you route all connections.

**Examples**

Listed below are examples of basic bus router operations:

• Moving the pointer before indicating a corner: only the guide route appears.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_18_Picture_16.jpeg)

• Indicating a corner point for the bus: the other bus connections or follow routes, are routed following the guide route's path. After you indicate a corner, the guide route is attached to the pointer. Continue indicating corners for the bus.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_19_Figure_1.jpeg)

• Bus routing in progress. For best results when adding corners, use the inside connection as the guide.

## Design Routing Visibility Options
SailWind Layout provides several visibility options to make routing your connections easier. By assigning specific colors to nets or unrouted connections, for example, you can quickly distinguish the net in the design. Similarly, by hiding unrouted connections that you do not need to see, you can make the design less cluttered.

### Assigning Colors to Nets
You can assign colors to pads, vias, and unrouted connections of a specific net. By default, pads, vias and unrouted connections assume the color given to them in the Display Colors dialog box. For example, assign a color to a plane net after placement. With all plane net pads appearing in a specific color, you can locate them quicker for fanning out to the plane layer.

There are many options available for net color assignment. See the table below for instructions.

### Highlighting a Net
Highlight a net to quickly locate it on a dense board.

**Tip**

To search for and select several nets, use the Find dialog boxon page 1378. Finding by nets finds and either highlights or selects nets.

**Procedure**

Type the N modeless commandon page 83, type a space after the N modeless command, type the netname and press the Enter key. As an alternative, you can select a net in the design by clicking on an unrouted connection, or pad and then click the **Edit> Highlight** menu item.

**Results**

The net appears in the Highlight color that is specified in the Display Colorson page 1318. The net is not selected: you have to select a segment if you intend to route it. The highlighting turns off when you select the net or a pin pair and click the **Edit> Unhighlight** menu item.

### Changing the Visibility of All Unrouted Connections
You can turn the display of all the unrouted connections (also called the "ratsnest") on and off by display color or commands.

By color:

- 1. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
- 2. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box, set the **Connection** color tile:
	- To the background color to make the connections invisible.
	- To a specific color from the color palette to distinguish it in the design.

By commands:

Available options are shown as below, which take no effect on nets that are locked in the View Nets Dialog Box.

### Viewing Protected Routes with Outline Mode
If your design contains protected routes, you can set them to display with the opposite outline pattern of other routes. In other words, if normal routes appear solid, protected routes have outlines, and so forth.

For more information, see "[Route and Unroute Protection"on page 696](#page-5-0).

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, click the Routing category > General subcategoryon page 1542.
- 3. Select the Show Protection check box.
- <span id="page-24-0"></span>4. Click **OK**.

## Routing To a Copper Shape
Unlike routing to a pad where you must route to the center of the pad to complete the connection, you only need to route to the edge of the copper.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

While in ECO - Add Route mode, you cannot terminate a newly created connection on copper. The connection must go between two component pins.

**Prerequisites**

- You must assign a net to the copper shape before you can route to it. For more information, see "Assigning a Net to a Copper Shape or Copper Plane"on page 665.
- The net you are routing must be the same as the net assigned to the copper.
- If you are routing to pin copper, the copper must be associated to the pin in the decal in order to router to it. For more information, see "Associating Copper with Terminals".

**Procedure**

- 1. As you are routing a net, guide the trace to the copper.
- 2. Choose an end point inside the perimeter of the copper. A targeton page 1854-like shape indicates that you have connected with the copper.

If you are routing on another layer, you can end the trace with a via into the copper. For more information, see "End Via [Mode"](#page-27-0).

3. Click to finish.

## Routing From a Copper Shape
There are limitations when routing from the copper. You must always select an area where a connection (unroute) emanates from the copper to start the routing process.

Because of this limitation, the recommended practice is to [route to the copperon page 715](#page-24-0) whenever possible for more flexible connection points.

**Prerequisites**

- You must assign a net to the copper shape before you can route to it. For more information, see "Assigning a Net to a Copper Shape or Copper Plane"on page 665.
- The net you are routing must be the same as the net assigned to the copper.
- If you are routing to pin copper, the copper must be associated to the pin in the decal in order to router to it. For more information, see "Associating Copper with Terminals".

**Procedure**

- 1. While in a routing mode, locate the point where a connection (unroute) is exiting the copper.
- 2. Click to begin the trace.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_25_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** You can route and add a via within the copper if you need to immediately change layers.

3. Route your trace.

**Results**

After routing, the ratsnest connection continues to exist in the design between the copper and other unrouted objects of that net. The connection disappears after all objects associated with that net are connected.

## End a Trace on a Different Net
You can end a trace on a segment with a different netname, but you must use the Add Route button on the ECO Toolbar.

For more information, see the "Adding a Route in ECO Mode" topic.

## Vias
Read the topics that follow to learn more about using vias when routing.

For topics covering the design of vias, see "Via Setup".

You can find more information about using vias to change layers in ["Layer Changes While Routing"](#page-47-0).

Via [Types](#page-26-1) [Adding](#page-26-2) Vias in Pads End Via [Mode](#page-27-0) [The Layer Pair](#page-27-1)

### Via Types
If you have different types of vias available to a net, you can switch between via modes to help select which via to use when routing.

You can use the V, VA, VP, VT modeless commands on page 83 as shortcuts to specify the Via Mode in the Vias dialog box on page 1782when you add a via or a virtual pin. When you choose a via type, it is used with the Add Via, Add Via to Guide, and Add Virtual Pin commands. For procedures, see "[Changing](#page-48-0)  the Via Type While [Routing](#page-48-0)".

The via must not create a clearance violation according to the default clearance rules or the clearance rules attached to the net you are routing, whichever takes precedence. If you set DRC to Prevent Errors, a layer change will not complete if the trace, via or virtual pin creates a clearance problem.

After you install a via or virtual pin, you can change it to another via type using the Via Properties Dialog Boxor Virtual Pin Properties Dialog Box.

### Adding Vias in Pads
You can add vias to SMD pads to avoid fanouts when there is no room for a regular fanout in the design.

**Procedure**

1. In the Clearance Rules Dialog Box, in the Same Net area, the SMD to Via clearance must be 0 (zero) at the required level of the rules hierarchy to enable the via to be placed in the pad.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_26_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** Also consider other via rules, such that the via cannot create a clearance violation. It must be allowed for the net and in drill pairs.

2. Select one or more SMD pads, right-click and click the **Add Via at SMD** popup menu item.

The via is added to the center of the SMD. Component pads always overlay vias and it may be difficult to determine if the via is actually inside the pad. Enable "Transparent mode" with the T modeless commandon page 83 to see vias in pads.

**Related Topics**

[Connecting SMD Pads to Planes](#page-72-0)

### End Via Mode
To end a trace with vias, tacks, or test points, use the commands on the **End Via Mode** submenu in the shortcut menu.

The available modes are listed below. The selected mode is on until you select a different one or exit SailWind Layout.

| Mode           | Description                                                                                                        |  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| End No Via     | Ends the connection with a tack. End No Via is the default setting.                                                |  |
| End Via        | Ends the connection with a via.                                                                                    |  |
| End Test Point | Adds a test point via. For related information, see "Placing Test<br>Points", and "Setting Test Point Properties". |  |

**Table 117. End Via Modes**

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_27_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you try to add a test point to an area defined as a test point keepout area when DRC mode is set to Prevent Errors, the message "Test point keepout violation" appears and the test point is not added.

**Related Topics**

[Routing Buses](#page-16-0)

### The Layer Pair
If you're working extensively between two layers, set them as the default layer pair, and while routing, right-click and click the **Layer Toggle** popup menu item, or shift-click to install a via and change to the other layer.

Set the layer pair in the Routing category > General subcategoryon page 1542 of the Options dialog box or as a shortcut, use the modeless commandon page 83 PL. Separate the modeless command and each layer number with a space.

To change layers outside the layer pair, use the L modeless command or right-click and click the **Layer**  popup menu item to specify the layer number.

[Layer Changes While Routing](#page-47-0)

## Teardrops
A *teardrop* (also referred to as a *pad fillet*) is typically a v-shaped copper reinforcement that you add to the junction where a trace enters a pad. Most PCB designs use teardrops primarily on pads that have a drilled hole, though there are circumstances where they may be beneficial on surface mount technology (SMT) pads.

When you choose to generate teardrops, they are created automatically on all traces leading into pads and vias. If pads and vias are not yet routed, the teardrop is added once the trace into the pad or via is completed. You do not add teardrops selectively, but you can remove teardrops selectively.

In the Options dialog box, use the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory to generate teardrops. Use the **Teardrops** category to set options only for teardrops on new traces that you route. These settings are saved with the design.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_28_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 97. Pads with Teardrops**

<span id="page-28-1"></span>**Benefits of Using Teardrops**

Teardrops provide solutions for a number of design issues, such as improving yield, preventing acid traps, and reducing flex circuit stress.

Checking [Teardrops](#page-35-0) for Errors

**Yield Improvement**

Teardrops can improve yield during the board manufacturing process when stacks of boards are drilled simultaneously.

A typical printed circuit board design can contain hundreds (and in some cases thousands) of drilled holes. If a manufacturer can drill a stack of 3 or 4 (or more) boards at the same time, they can improve throughput, and therefore reduce the overall cost of the board run. Unfortunately, as the height of the board stack increases, the potential for the drill to "wander" off of its centerline also increases. The farther the drill has to travel, the more potential there is for it to veer off its intended path, and produce a hole that is off-center on the pads of the lower board(s) in the stack. Though the variance is typically only a few thousandths of an inch, this small movement can cause the drill hole to become tangent to the edge of the pad, and if it occurs at the location where a trace connects to the pad, it can result in breakout or an open circuit.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_29_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 98. Drilling a Stack of Boards**

Adding a teardrop to the pad increases the target area around the trace-to-pad connection and can compensate for some amount of the drill drift. This allows the connection to be made even if the drill is tangent to the pad edge and encroaches on the connection area.

This technique is effective on both round and square through-hole pads.

**Figure 99. Pads with Breakouts**

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_30_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Acid Trap Prevention**

Teardrops can reduce the potential of acid traps at the trace-to-pad junction.

The location where the trace enters the pad poses a potential for the etching solution (acid) to build up in the sharp corners and over-etch the junction. This can result in a slight narrowing of the trace as it enters the pad and potentially creating a connection that is more prone to fracturing. This over-etching can also slightly reduce the current handling capacity of the trace at the junction creating a potential failure point.

Adding a teardrop to the connection point eliminates the potential problem. It does not matter if the drill is centered or offset in the pad.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_30_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 100. Acid Trap Reduction**

**Stress Failure Reduction**

Teardrops can reduce the potential for stress failures on flex circuits.

The location where the trace enters the pad can be subject to constant stress on a flex circuit. As the flex circuit is bent, it stresses this connection, and if the movement is repeated enough times, it could eventually cause the junction to fracture and fail.

Adding a teardrop to the connection point adds additional surface area to this potential stress point and greatly improves the ability of the board to withstand the effects of the repeated stress. It does not matter if the drill is centered or offset in the pad.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_31_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 101. Stress Failure Reduction**

**Teardrops on SMT Pads**

The same design benefits of acid trap reduction and stress fracture reduction obtained from using teardrops on through-hole pads can also be applied to surface mount design objects.

[Teardrops](#page-28-0)

### Generating Teardrops
You can create teardrops on trace connections to pads and vias. If desired, you can also enable connections not yet routed to automatically create teardrops after they are routed.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot place default-shaped teardrops on square pads.
- You cannot place teardrops on traces when a trace corner is inside the pad or via or if the segment is too short. Use the additional teardrop option Auto Adjust to solve this. This option is in the **Routing** category > **Teardrops** subcategory of the Options dialog box. Use Auto Adjust to set

a custom length and width ratio. With Auto Adjust selected, SailWind Layout attempts to adjust the length of the teardrop on traces where the trace corner is inside the pad or via or the segment is too short to contain the specified length ratio.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, on the Routing category > General subcategoryon page 1542, select the Generate Teardrops check box.
- 3. Click **OK**.

Teardrops are automatically added to existing trace segments that enter or leave a pad or via or whenever you route that connection. Teardrops may not appear on all existing pads if the traces going in to the pads are not centered. Re-route the traces from the pads to the first corners to fix these exceptions.

**Tip**

If you do not want a teardrop on a specific trace you are routing, after you begin routing the trace, right-click and click the **Ignore Teardrop** popup menu item to turn on the Ignore Teardrop mode. A teardrop will not appear on traces that you route until you right-click and click the **Ignore Teardrop** popup menu item again, to turn off Ignore Teardrop mode. A check appears beside the command on the menu to indicate that the mode is turned on.

**Results**

If you have not changed the teardrop options in a previous SailWind Layout session, the Default teardrop shape is used for all newly routed trace connections to pads and vias. You can set more specific options for teardrops if you have the additional teardrop functionality using the **Routing** category > Teardrops on page 1546 subcategory in the Options dialog box.

### Removing All Teardrops
You can delete or remove teardrops from a design by reversing the process for creating them.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, on the **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542, clear the Generate Teardrops check box.

### Disable the Display of Teardrops
You can also temporarily disable the display of teardrops without removing them from the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, on the **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542, in the Parameters area, clear the Display Teardrops check box.

### Selectively Disabling Teardrops
You can turn teardrops off selectively at the pin level.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or more pins. To clear multiple pins, set the Selection Filteron page 1710 to "Pins only", and draw a selection rectangle to select multiple pins. As long as all the selected pins are teardrop-enabled, you can open the Properties dialog box to disable teardrops.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Pin Properties Dialog Box, clear the Teardrops check box.

### Teardrops in CAM
When you plot teardrops, the line width you use is the same as the track width. If the teardrop is on an annular-shaped pad, SailWind Layout uses the difference between the outer pad radius and the inner pad radius as the line width if that amount is less than the track width.

**Related Topics**

Modifying Teardrop [Properties](#page-34-2)

Teardrop Properties on Traces Dialog Box

### Modifying Teardrop Properties
You can modify the teardrop shape, length ratio, and width ratio for any selected teardrop. You can modify teardrops individually, teardrops on all layers, or all teardrops at one time. You can also remove an individual teardrop from a design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or more traces to which teardrops are attached. If you select in the middle of a trace with teardrops at each end, both teardrops are edited. Select the trace near the teardrop you want to modify to edit only one teardrop.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Teardrop Properties** popup menu item.

The Teardrop Properties on Traces Dialog Box appears.

3. Make changes and then click **OK**.

**Results**

• If you selected multiple traces and modify teardrops on those traces or apply teardrop property changes to multiple teardrops, only existing teardrops are modified. Newly created teardrops always use the settings in the **Routing** category > Teardrops subcategory on page 1546 of the Options dialog box.

- If you selected Layer or All from the Apply To area, Auto Adjust changes to a third state, neither on nor off. This occurs because Auto Adjust reads the Auto Adjust setting for more than one trace and they can vary. You can still change Auto Adjust.
- You cannot preview teardrops when you select Layer or All.

### Checking Teardrops for Errors
You can run a check on teardrops—using a similar method to the Verify Design dialog box—to check for and view teardrop errors. SailWind Layout gives the error location, layer, and a short explanation of the error. Start the teardrop checking process through the **Routing** category > **Teardrops** subcategory of the Options dialog box instead of the Verify Design dialog box.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item. The Options dialog box opens. You must enable teardrops before you can check them. On the **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542, select the Generate Teardrops check box.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, click the **Routing** category > Teardrops subcategory on page 1546.
- 3. Click the **Check** button.
- 4. In the Check Teardrop Dialog Box, click **Start** to run the check. Error results are listed in the Location box. Listed errors contain their (X,Y) location, layer, and error type.
- 5. Select an error from the list.
	- In the Explanation box, view the detailed information about the error selected in the Location list. The explanation includes information about any conflicting object. The current error list remains whether the dialog box is open or closed.
	- The design window pans to the area of the error (unless the Disable Panning check box is selected). This is more obvious if you are zoomed into your design and the marker is set to show up in the design. The error markers remain until you click **Clear Errors**, which clears the error markers, but does not fix the errors.

**Tip**

Colors must be assigned properly in the Display Colors Setup Dialog Boxin order to see error markers. Errors in the design area appear in the color of the Errors check boxes per layer of the Display Colors dialog box. When an error is selected in the Location box, the error in the design area appears in the "Highlight" color.

**Results**

You can view the current error results in your default text editor. To view the most recently run report results in the default text editor, click **View Report**. You can print or save the results from your default text editor.

To change the default teardrop report file name, click **Report File**. This opens the Save As dialog box where you can change the name of the report. The changed name remains the default until you change it again.

## Tacks
SailWind Layout generates tacks, which most commonly occur at corners where traces are routed against the layer direction.

You can also add Tacks on page 1864 manually. They can even be deleted in some cases, but it is not recommended since it will typically remove the corner at the same time and change the path of the routed trace.

You can add tacks manually to lock a corner or prevent rerouting when using the dynamic route or bus route tool. While routing click to lock down a corner with a tack. When there are no tacks, traces can be shoved to allow room for another trace to be routed.

When the tack is not required for a route direction change, pressing Delete removes the corner beneath the tack and moves the tack to the next "U" point in the route. The Selection Filteron page 1710 contains an option for tacks so you can set the filter to select only tacks. To delete a manually added tack select it and press the Delete key.

## Jumpers
Read the topics that follow to learn more about creating, adding, and modifying jumpers.

[Setting Up Jumpers](#page-37-1) [Setting Up Jumper Pad Stacks](#page-38-0) [Adding Jumpers](#page-39-0) [Creating Jumper List Reports](#page-40-0) [Modifying Jumper Properties](#page-40-1) [Modifying Jumper Name Properties](#page-41-0) [Modifying Jumper Pin Properties](#page-41-1)

### Setting Up Jumpers
When you add a jumper to the design, SailWind Layout uses the Default jumper. You can change the Default jumper settings or change the settings for a specific jumper in the design. The attributes of the default jumper save to the *SailWindpcb.ini* file. Open the pin properties to change the setting of a specific pin in the design.

Use the Jumpers dialog box to set up and modify jumpers and jumper pad stacks. You can create and modify SMD jumpers (single layer jumpers) on the top or bottom mounting layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Jumpers** menu item.
- 2. In the Jumpers Dialog Box, in the Apply to area click:
	- **Default**  to change the settings of the Default jumper any new jumper added to the design. The settings are saved in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file.
	- **Design**  and then select a jumper name in the Reference Name list—to change the settings of an existing jumper in the design.
- 3. Modify the jumper size settings. To modify the jumper size settings of Design Jumpers, use the Jumper Propertieson page 1425. In the Jumper Sizes area:
	- a. In the Min. Length and Max. Length boxes, type the minimum and maximum length of the jumper.
	- b. In the Jumper Sizes area, in the Increment box, type the increment, at which you can stretch the jumper between the minimum and maximum lengths.
- 4. [Set up the pad stackson page 729](#page-38-0).
- 5. In the Drill Size box type the drill size if the jumper is a through hole jumper. Type a drill size of zero if you want a surface mount jumper with round pads.
- 6. Select the Display Silk check box to display the silkscreen outline for the jumper. The outline for jumpers is set at 10 mils; you cannot modify this setting. To modify the Display Silk settings of Design Jumpers, use the Jumper Propertieson page 1425. For CAM output, you must enable Component Outlines for the layer on which the jumper resides before jumper outlines will plot.

### Setting Up Jumper Pad Stacks
You can set up pad stack information for jumpers or individual jumper pins.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Jumpers** menu item.
- 2. In the Jumpers Dialog Box, in the Apply to area click:
	- **Default**  to change the settings of the Default jumper any new jumper added to the design. The settings are saved in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file.
	- **Design**  and then select a jumper name in the Reference Name list—to change the settings of an existing jumper in the design.
- 3. In the Pin list, select both jumper pin (All) or a pin to change. You can add individual pins of the jumper to the list for customizing. Use the **Add** or **Delete** button to maintain the Pin list.
- 4. In the Shape/Size/Layer list select a layer on which to make jumper pad stack changes. When modifying Design jumpers, you can add individual layers of the design to the list for customizing the design jumper. Use the **Add** or **Delete** button to maintain the Shape/Size/Layer list.
- 5. In the Parameters area, select the type of pad from the Pad Style list.

Choose from (normal) pad, thermal (pad), or antipad. You cannot create antipads on outer layers. When you select an outer layer (<Start> or <End>) in the Size/Shape/Layer list, Antipad is unavailable. You can click **Use Global Defaults** to set the Thermal and Antipad shapes, of a layer and pin, to the default shapes specified by the design rules and the design Options > Copper Planes category > Thermals subcategoryon page 1514. The **Use Global Defaults** button is only available when the Pad Style list is set to Thermal or Antipad.

Thermal and Antipad display configuration controls the size and shape of thermals and antipads used on split/mixed layers and CAM negative planes (for RS-274X output).

6. Select a Pad Shape.

Choose from: Round, Square, Annular, or Odd. Annular and Odd shapes are only available for the normal pad style. You can select the Pad Size Relative to Drill Size check box to display inner and outer pad values relative to the drill size.

7. In the Diameter box, type the diameter for the pad style.

Thermals require additional settings. Read "Design Rule Versus Pad Stack - Thermals and Antipads"on page 797for details.

8. Square pads only: Select the Corner type and enter the Radius.

**Results**

You can view the effect of your pad settings in the Pad Preview display.

### Adding Jumpers
You can place jumpers in a trace either while routing or after you finish routing. SailWind Layout considers jumper pins as vias. The space between the jumper pins does not have electrical properties. Jumper pins are checked for Design Rule clearances as vias.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_39_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** SailWind Router can load and autoroute jumperson page 1835.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Jumpers do not follow the Body to Body, Default Design Rule in batch and On-line DRC.
- Jumper silkscreens are not user configurable.
- You cannot use Find to search for jumpers.
- Cluster Place ignores jumpers.
- For CAM output, you must enable Component Outlines for the layer on which the jumper resides before jumper silkscreen outlines will plot. The outline for jumpers is set at 10 mils; you cannot modify this setting.

**Procedure**

- 1. Unless you want to use the default jumper, set up a jumper:
	- a. Click the **Setup> Jumpers** menu item.
	- b. In the Jumpers Dialog Box, change the stackup of the jumper pins and the jumper size settings. For more information, see "[Setting Up Jumpers](#page-37-1)".
- 2. Start the jumper in one of the following ways:
	- While routing locate the pointer at the point where you want the first pin of the jumper to appear.
	- On an existing trace select the trace at the point where you want the first pin of the jumper to appear. As an alternative, on the Design Toolbar click **Add Jumper** and then click a point on a trace where you want the first pin of the jumper to appear.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Add Jumper** popup menu item. The first pin of the jumper appears.
- 4. Move the mouse to stretch the jumper. You can stretch between Minimum Length and Maximum Length jumper settings at a preset increment. The angle mode also applies.
- 5. Click to complete the jumper.
	- If you are adding a jumper to an existing trace, you must enter the second pin on a trace in the same net.
	- If you added a trace while routing, regular routing continues.

## Operations While Routing
You can access certain operations or features while routing in SailWind Layout.

Trace Length [Monitor](#page-43-1) [Activating](#page-45-0) the Trace Length Monitor [Routing Direction](#page-45-1) Layer [Selection](#page-46-1) for Starting a Trace Adding a Via While [Routing](#page-46-0) [Creating Arcs](#page-47-1) [Layer Changes While Routing](#page-47-0) [Changing](#page-48-0) the Via Type While Routing [Changing](#page-49-0) the Trace Width While Routing [Troubleshooting](#page-49-1) Routing on Another Layer Traces Ended on [Different](#page-50-0) Nets

### Trace Length Monitor
The trace length monitor calculates and shows the trace length (on the status bar and near the pointer) as you route. When design rules for the net specify a length, then red or green text in the monitor indicates whether the length is within the specified rules.

- Red text indicates violations of the rule.
- Green text indicates trace lengths within the rule.

The status bar shows detailed length information.

The trace length monitor shows the routed length and the estimated total length of the net. For more information, see "Trace Length [Monitor"](#page-43-1).

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_43_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 103. The Trace Length Monitor**

**Color Customization for the Trace Length Monitor**

You can set the colors of the text in the monitor that indicate whether the length is within the specified rules. Set the colors in the *SailWindpcb.ini* file. In the *.ini* file, look for the [monitor] section that resembles the following:

[monitor] normal = 10 norules = 15 error = 12

The numbers represent colors from the [Colormap] section of the *.ini* file. To change the colors used in the monitor, change the numbers in the [monitor] section to a color from the [Colormap] section. Values may be 0-31.

**Effects of Reroute and Smooth on Trace Length**

During reroute operations, the trace length monitor may show a length greater that the actual final length. In addition, for dynamic routing, smoothing operations and pad entry corrections may be performed on traces after you finish routing (depending on your Options dialog box > **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542 settings). These operations may change trace length slightly.

**Trace Length Monitor Reports**

As mentioned, the trace length monitor shows the net length rules, the current routed length, and the estimated total length. The rules that are reported are net length rules. As shown in [Table](#page-44-0) [118,](#page-44-0) the trace length monitor reports different information depending on the length rule.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>

| Length Rule                     | Information in Report                                                                                                                                                       |

**Table 118. Trace Length Monitor Reports**

### Activating the Trace Length Monitor
The trace length monitor calculates and shows trace length as you route. As you move the pointer and route traces, the routed and unrouted length of nets or pin pairs and associated rules are shown near the pointer and on the status bar.

The trace length monitor is available for the following commands:

- Route/Add Route
- Dynamic Route
- Move Segment
- Move Corner
- Move Via

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, on the **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542, select the Show Trace Length check box.
- 3. Click **OK**.

This turns the display of the trace length monitor on or off at the pointer only. The trace length always displays on the status bar.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_45_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also use the shortcuton page 100 Ctrl+PageUp to turn the trace length monitor on or off. Turning the trace length monitor on or off does not end the current routing command; you can continue to route.

**Related Topics**

Trace Length [Monitor](#page-43-1)

### Routing Direction
When you start routing, SailWind Layout automatically chooses the end from which you start. If you want to start from the opposite end of the connection, right-click and click the **Swap End** popup menu item. Also, at any point while you are routing, click (add a corner) to preserve what you have already routed and switch to the opposite end of the connection to route from the opposite direction.

Swap End is available only in [Add Routeon page 699](#page-8-1) and [Dynamic Routeon page 700](#page-9-0) modes.

### Layer Selection for Starting a Trace
When you start routing a trace, it assumes the layer of the object from which it began the connection, such as a pad, via, or copper area. If it starts routing from a through-hole pad or a via, you can set the current routing layer before you start routing.

Choose one of the following methods to set the layer before routing:

- On the Standard Toolbar, in the Layer list, choose the layer.
- Change the current layer by typing the L modeless commandon page 83, typing the layer number, and pressing the Enter key.

A layer's current direction setting appears next to its entry in the Layer list. You can change the layer's current direction setting by typing the LD modeless command.

When you select a connection and select a routing mode, the route begins on that layer. When you end a route on a different layer than where you began it, the layer you ended on becomes the active layer and appears in the Layer list box. The next connection you select starts on this active layer.

### Adding a Via While Routing
You can add a via during routing to either continue routing on another layer or to connect to a plane area.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have created a via type for use with your design. For more information, see "Creating a Through-hole Via Type" and "Creating a Partial Via Type".
- The via must be available for use, and both source and destination layers must be available for routing according to the applicable Routing Ruleson page 1666.

**Procedure**

- 1. While routing, use one of the following methods to add a via:
	- Right-click and click the **Add Via** popup menu item to continue routing on another layer.
	- Click to place a tack and then [change to the desired new layeron page 738](#page-47-0) to continue routing. The via is added automatically in the location of the tack.

If the via is a restricted via, ensure the requirements to this procedure are in place.

If a violation is detected, the via grid or a clearance rule could be preventing the placement of the via. Also, the layer you are routing to could be unavailable for routing. Ensure the requirements to this procedure are in place.

**Tip**

Instead on continuing routing after you add a via, you can end the trace with a via. You would use this method to fan out a plane net to the plane layer. While routing, right-click, point to the **End Via Mode** popup menu item, and then click the **End Via** popup submenu item to set the mode. Right-click and click the **End** popup menu item to end the trace with a via. The trace ends with a Via. If there is a plane area on the path of the via, it will either connect with a thermal connection if necessary or add an antipad if it should not connect.

2. Continue routing on the new layer.

### Creating Arcs
While routing, you can create arcs instead of corners.

**Procedure**

- 1. While routing, right-click and click the **Add Arc** popup menu item. The segment extending from the last corner is converted to an arc.
- 2. Move the pointer to adjust and indicate the radius.
- 3. Click to complete the arc. Routing continues from this point.

**Related Topics**

[Stretching an Arc or Miter](#page-62-0)

### Layer Changes While Routing
To change layers while routing, use the L modeless command while the trace is active. The "L" command installs a via at the last corner and moves the segment of your trace (stretching from the via to the pointer) onto the specified layer. The Via Type dialog box settings control the type of via you place. The trace color changes accordingly and the new layer appears in the Layer list on the Standard Toolbar.

If the layer change is allowed, a via is installed at the last corner when you change layers either while routing or after entering the trace. You can use the design rules to use a specific via by default. Since partial vias undergo a checking process, you cannot set them this way by default; they are chosen automatically depending on the circumstances of layer change.

**Conditions for Changing Layers**

Operations for changing layers in interactive routing are the same for the Route command and Dynamic Route Editor.

When you change layers, you must meet several requirements before you can place a via. First, the layer change must be a legal drill pair, the start and finish layer numbers. This check affects multiple layer boards. Establish pairs by clicking the **Setup> Drill Pairs** menu item, according to your projected manufacturing plan. Once you enter drill pairs, you are warned if you are joining two layers that do not match your manufacturing scheme.

For more information on setting up through hole vs. partial vias, see Via Setup.

**Layer Change Methods**

There are several ways to install a via and change layers while routing:

- If you are working extensively between two layers, set them as the default "Layer Pair" in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > General subcategoryon page 1542. You can also use the PL modeless commandon page 83. While routing, right-click and click the **Layer Toggle** popup menu item or press the F4 key.
- Type the L modeless commandon page 83, the new layer number, and press the Enter key.
- Right-click and click the **Layer** popup menu item. This opens the Modeless Command window with the L command already typed for you. After the L command, type the new layer number and then press the Enter key.
- On the Standard Toolbar, in the Layer list, select the new layer.

The type of via placed is determined by the Vias Dialog Box settings. You can also use the V modeless commandson page 83.

**Related Topics**

Adding a Via While [Routing](#page-46-0)

### Changing the Via Type While Routing
While routing, you can change the type of via that SailWind Layout uses for via additions.

**Procedure**

1. While routing, right-click and click the **Via Type** popup menu item.

The Vias Dialog Box appears. You can leave the Vias dialog box open to quickly change from one via type to another.

- 2. In the Via Mode area click a via type.
- 3. If the via is a through hole, click the via type to use in the Via List list.

If you click automatic, SailWind Layout selects a via type based on which via types are allowed for the net in the Routing Ruleson page 1666 dialog box and which via types are legal for the layer change according to the Drill Pairs Setupon page 1337 dialog box. If more than one via type qualifies on both counts, the product uses the smaller drill diameter and/or smaller pad size.

4. Click **OK**. The new via type is used until you change it.

### Changing the Trace Width While Routing
When you change the trace width, the current routing width changes from the last corner, leaving segments before the last corner at their original width. All subsequent segments draw at the new width, until you reach the next pin in the net. The width stays associated with the connection until you change it.

The "Recommended" trace width settingon page 1167 for the net stays unchanged. If you end with a partial route and use it later, the width you set separately is still in effect.

**Procedure**

- 1. While routing, type the W modeless commandon page 83. This changes the "Default width" setting in the Options dialog box > **Drafting** category > Text and Lines subcategory on page 1553. You can also change the width in the Grid/Width dialog boxon page 1398.
- 2. Type the new width and then press the Enter key. The line width area on the status bar changes accordingly.

**Related Topics**

### Troubleshooting Routing on Another Layer
You can use a via to switch to another layer while routing but many rules or settings can prevent you from routing on another layer.

If you have trouble, here is a list of things to check:

- Is the via type in the Selected layers list? In the Routing ruleson page 1666 at each level of the hierarchy, you can disable a via for routing by keeping it out of the Selected vias list.
- Is the layer in the Selected layers list in the Layer biasing? In the Routing ruleson page 1666 at each level of the Rules hierarchy, you can disable a layer for routing by keeping it out of the Selected Layers list in the Layer biasing area.
- Is the layer check box cleared in the Selection Filter? In the Selection Filter, on the Layer tabon page 1708, you can clear the check box of a layer. Nothing on that layer is selectable - including the pad of the via from which you are trying to route.
- Is the active layer not coming to the front? In the Options dialog box > Global category > General subcategoryon page 1531, you can select the "Active layer comes to front" check box to bring the layer forward. Then you can select items on that layer more easily.
- Is there a conditional rule which prevents this net from routing on this layer, or near these components?

### Traces Ended on Different Nets
To end a trace on a segment with a different netname, use the ECO Toolbar routing command. SailWind Layout assumes you are intentionally joining two nets to make one, and considers it an engineering change. SailWind Layout records it in the database as such.

You must assign a new netname: either use one of the names from the nets you just combined or use a third name. For instructions, see "Adding a Route in ECO Mode".

## Refined Object Selection
You can use additional selection filter shortcuts after selecting a design object. Right-click and click a selection shortcut.

[Selecting Nets From an Electrical Object](#page-51-1) [Selecting Pin Pairs From an Object](#page-51-2) [Selecting Classes from Nets](#page-51-3) [Selecting Groups from Pin Pairs](#page-52-0) [Selecting Drafting Objects from Segments/Corners](#page-52-1)

### Selecting Nets From an Electrical Object
You can select an assigned net of an electrical object quickly. Electrical objects include trace objects, pins, copper objects, planes, and unroutes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Net** popup menu item, or press the F6 key. The entire net is selected, including routes, connections, and pins.

### Selecting Pin Pairs From an Object
You can select all pin pairs attached to a pin, trace segment, corner, tack, or via.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Pin Pairs** popup menu item, or press the F5 key.

### Selecting Classes from Nets
A *class* is a collection of nets with a common set of design rules. You can define classes graphically or by using the Class Rules dialog box.

For more information about classes, see "Design Rule Hierarchy."

If you have created net classes, you can quickly select all items such as pins, traces, and unrouted pin pairs within them, or determine the class of a net.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a net.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Class** popup menu item.

### Selecting Groups from Pin Pairs
A group is a collection of pin pairs with a common set of design rules. You can define groups using the Group Rules dialog box.

For more information about groups, see "Design Rule Hierarchy".

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a pin pair of a group.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Group** popup menu item. All pin pairs of the group are selected.

### Selecting Drafting Objects from Segments/Corners
You can use the Select Shape command to select an entire drafting object from one of its segments or corners.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the drafting segment or corner.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Shape** popup menu item.

## Operations After Routing
SailWind Layout offers detail tools to help you clean up or modify routed trace patterns, perform a completely reroute, or protect routes from further modifications.

**Tip** If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation. You can, however, copy trace patterns from a physical design reuse.

To view obstacles that may lie under traces on the current active layer use Transparent View Mode, modeless commandon page 83 T.

### Moving a Trace Segment to Another Layer
Instead of rerouting an entire trace, you can move a trace segment to another layer and allow SailWind Layout to add vias automatically at the opposite ends of the trace segment.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or more continuous trace segments.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Trace Properties Dialog Box, select the layer you want from the Layer list.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The trace segment moves to the selected layer and vias are automatically placed at the segment end points.

If nothing happens, design rules may have been violated. For example, there may not be enough room for a via or traces may not be permitted on the layer you have chosen.

### Rerouting with Route or Dynamic Route
You can reroute traces by starting and ending a new replacement trace anywhere along the existing trace. You can start and end reroutes on segments, pins, and vias.

**Prerequisites**

- The existing and new traces must have the same netname.
- The net must be enabled for copper sharing. To enable copper sharing, use the Routing Ruleson page 1666 dialog box for the net and select Copper Sharing. To enable sharing for all nets, in the Rules dialog box,on page 1674 click **Default** and select Copper Sharing in the Routing area.

**Procedure**

1. Select a trace segment at the point where you want to start the reroute.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_54_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip** Use Transparent View Mode, modeless commandon page 83 T, to view obstacles that may lie under traces on the current active layer.

2. Right-click and click the **Route** or **Dynamic Route** popup menu item. The new trace begins at the selection point.

- If you reroute a segment that has a via or jumper pin that is a locked test point, the locked test point is not deleted. The test point remains connected by an unroute.
- If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.
- 3. Route the new trace segment. You can end on a trace when the pointer changes to a bull's-eye as you move the route in progress over the segment into which you want to T-connect. If you have created a connection loop, the "Delete Loop?" message appears. Click **OK** to delete the highlighted segment or click **Next** to cycle through the other segments in the loop. Click **OK** to delete the highlighted segment.
- 4. To complete the route, double-click or right-click and click the **Complete** popup menu item.

### Rerouting with Sketch Route
Use Sketch Route to reroute a set of trace segments between two pins. A pin in this case may be a component pin, via, or tack.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Sketch Route cannot move a tack, so most traces that travel in the wrong direction, or have tacks for any other reason, are ineligible for Sketch Rerouting.

**Procedure**

1. Type the drp modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to enable the online design rule checking Prevent mode and the **Sketch Route** button.

For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking," and "Design Rule Checking."

- 2. Activate the Sketch Route command using one of the following:
	- Object mode select the first segment of the series you want to edit, then right-click and click the **Sketch Route** popup menu item.
	- Verb mode on the Design Toolbar, click the **Sketch Route** button and then click on a trace segment at the point where you want to change the trace pattern.

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

- 3. A thin dotted line appears that moves with the pointer. Use this line to mark the general location of the new trace. You do not have to enter any corners.
- 4. Click to indicate the end of the sketched route. This completes the trace, routing through the defined path.

### Smoothing Trace Segments
Smoothing removes unnecessary segments from a trace and converts ninety-degree corners to forty-five degree corners whenever possible. This option is only available with the Dynamic Route Editing licensing option.

**Procedure**

1. Type the drp modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to enable the online design rule checking Prevent mode.

For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking," and "Design Rule Checking."

- 2. Select a trace segment.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Smooth** popup menu item.

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

### Changing the Pad Entry Angle
After you complete routing a connection from pin to pin, you can change the pad entry angle into the pin.

The Trace/Line Angle setting in the Options dialog box > Design subcategoryon page 1503 determines the angle of pad entry when you complete a trace. You can also use Trace/Line Angle in the Status Dialog Box.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the segment.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Pad Entry** popup menu item.

The final segment changes its orientation and adjusts the attached segments accordingly if possible. If the new pad entry causes a clearance error, the process is canceled.

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

### Copying and Pasting Trace Patterns
You can reproduce repetitive routing patterns by making one example of a segment pattern, copying it, and pasting it on any similar connections. The selection includes layer changes and vias in the path.

Memory patterns or SMD fanouts are ideal applications for copied routes. When you select and copy a trace or a trace and via combination, you start a specialized operation that immediately attaches a copy of the selected routing to the pointer and lets you repeatedly paste with a mouse click.

**Procedure**

1. Select anything from a single trace segment up to a pin pair in length.

Your selection can include vias. The copy feature does not work on trace patterns longer that a single pin pair. Select multiple items by Ctrl+click. Selections can include vias.

2. Click the **Edit> Copy** menu item, or press Ctrl+C.

All included segments and vias are copied and attached to your pointer in Move mode.

- 3. If needed, right-click and use the shortcut menu commands to rotate or flip the copy.
- 4. Position the pointer over the location of the pins to which you want to paste.

A copy is pasted and another copy remains attached to the pointer so you can paste it again. A copied trace only pastes to a valid electrical connection: you cannot paste to empty space. If the copied traces are shorter than the target pin pair, a connection is created from the end of the copy to the other pin of the pair.

The pointer then snaps automatically to a point the same distance from and in the same direction as the last placement. This makes it easy to install repetitive route patterns.

5. Press the Esc key to cancel further copies.

### Creating Route Loops
You can reroute from point to point along the same net without deleting the previous path. This causes the new route to branch off the existing route, creating a loop.

**Procedure**

- 1. Indicate the location on the route segment where you want the branch to occur.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Route Loop** popup menu item.

A new route starts at the selection point. You can also start Route Loop using the Ctrl+J shortcut keys.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_57_Picture_21.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

- 3. Indicate the location for each corner of the new route.
- 4. Indicate the location where the loop branches back into the existing route.

### Moving a Trace Segment
You can move traces if you need to make room for other routing objects.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the trace segment.
- 2. Use one of these methods to start the move.
	- Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
	- Press Ctrl+E.
	- Select the trace segment and drag. Use the Options dialog box > Global category > General subcategoryon page 1531 to click a drag and drop method, or to prohibit pointer-drag moves.

The selection attaches to the pointer.

3. Click to indicate the new route location.

**Related Topics**

[Stretching an Arc or Miter](#page-62-0)

### Trace Shove During a Move
You can use the shortcut menu to enable or disable trace shoving, or moving, when you move traces. If you want to move traces aside, when the trace is in Move mode, right-click and click the **Shove** popup menu item to enable the shove feature.

This feature requires that you have the Dynamic Route Editing installed option.

The following restrictions apply:

- If you set DRC to Prevent or Warn, you cannot create a clearance violation when you relocate the trace.
- If you move a trace that is attached to a via or pin that is a locked test point, a Warning dialog box appears informing you of changes to the test point and giving you options. For more information, see "Modifying a Route Attached to a Locked Test Point."

• If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

**Tip** Use Transparent View Mode, the modeless commandon page 83 T, to view obstacles that may lie under traces on the current active layer.

### Deleting a Trace Segment
You can delete trace segments to restore the unroute connection.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the segment.
- 2. Press the Delete key, or click the **Edit> Delete** menu item. When you delete a trace segment, an unroute connection line is restored.

If you delete a trace that is attached to a via that is a test point, the via is automatically deleted with the trace unless the test point is locked. If the test point is locked, it remains connected by an unroute.

If you try to delete a segment that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "The command cannot be applied to reuse elements" appears in the status bar.

### Unrouting All Segments Attached to the Pads of a Component
You can unroute the first segment attached to each pin of a component. Use the "Unroute Attached Segments" command to reroute each connection that terminates at the part, or when replacing a component in the design. When you unroute a segment, tacks appear at the end of the connection where it meets the route. If the unrouted segment ends at a via, SailWind Layout creates a connection between the via and the unrouted pin.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the component from which you want to unroute attached segments.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Unroute Attached Segments** popup menu item.

The first segments are unrouted and tacks appear at the end of the routes.

**Restriction:**

If you try unroute segments that are part of a physical design reuse, the message "The command cannot be applied to reuse elements" appears on the status bar.

**Results**

When you unroute all final segments into a component, in some cases it may appear as though a trace is still connected to a pad. This occurs when the final two segments end within the bounds of the pad. See the example in the graphic below.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_60_Picture_3.jpeg)

### Changing the Width of an Existing Trace
You can change the width of routed traces at the segment, pin pair, or net level.

**Tip** You can also use the **Edit> Find** menu item to find all traces of a similar width, select them, and change them to a new width.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a segment, pin pair, or net.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Trace Properties on page 1757, Pin Pair Propertieson page 1627, or Net Properties dialog boxon page 1487, in the Width or Trace Width box, type the new width and click **OK**.

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

### Creating Arc Miters
You can create a small, smooth arc effect by mitering a routed 90 degree corner. Such an ability is useful if you need to automatically add arcs to many corners in the design.

If you want to manually add an arc, see "[Converting](#page-61-0) a Trace Corner to an Arc".

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item. The Options dialog box opens.
- 2. On the Design categoryon page 1503, in the Miters area, click Arc.
- 3. Set the Ratio.

Ratio is the ratio of the arc radius to the trace width; for example, for a 12-mil trace, a ratio of 1 produces a radius of 12; a ratio of 2 produces a radius of 24.

4. To apply the miter, select the corner, right-click, and click the **Add Miter** popup menu item.

Trace segments that are too short for the specified ratio are not mitered. You can also select one or more pin pairs, right-click and click **Add Miter**.

**Restriction:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

### Converting a Trace Corner to an Arc
Use the "Convert to Arc" command to create an arc from two intersecting route segments. You can manually pull the arc to the radius that you need.

If you need to automatically add arcs to many corners in the design, see ["Creating Arc Miters"](#page-60-1).

**Procedure**

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace segment, trace corner, or trace end point at the location of the via you want to place.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Add Via** popup menu item.

The via is added at the point where you selected the trace object. The via is a plain via. The Stitching or Glued settings are not enabled for the via. To add traces to unrouted connections, pin pairs or nets, see "Adding [Stitching](#page-67-0) Vias".

**Note:**

If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the modifying operation.

### Stitching Vias
Use stitching vias to interconnect copper areas of nets including copper planes or CAM planes.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_67_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Note:**

SailWind Layout does not consider stitching vias to be orphaned vias and does not delete them during routing optimization. If you use the Select Dangling Routes command, it will select stitching vias. Glue stitching vias to keep them from being deleted if you select dangling routes and delete them as part of your design process.

Adding [Stitching](#page-67-0) Vias [Selecting](#page-68-0) Stitching Vias [Changing](#page-68-1) Stitching Via Types Deleting [Stitching](#page-68-2) Vias [Converting](#page-69-1) Routing Vias into Stitching Vias

#### Adding Stitching Vias
You must associate stitching vias with a net. You can add them to the design through the net selection of an object in the design.

Stitching vias interact with many commands in SailWind Layout:

- The All Except Connected Plane Nets option in the View Nets dialog box disables unroute display to stitching vias that are embedded in copper planes, or CAM planes. Also, Length Minimization calculates both the pads and drills of the stitching via to determine the unroute visibility to a stitching via.
- When you copy trace patterns, stitching vias are also copied. Copied stitching vias snap to the via grid when pasted.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a net (you can click trace segments, vias, pins, unroutes, copper, and copper planes), pin pair, or unroute in the design.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Add Via** popup menu item to attach the new via to the pointer.
- 3. Click to place the stitching via.

Another stitching via attaches to the pointer. You can place vias repeatedly. If unroutes are visible for the selected net, a new unroute will connect to the stitching via.

4. Right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item to stop adding stitching vias.

**Results**

When you add a via to an unroute, pin pair or net, the result is a via with a Stitching setting enabled. By default, stitching vias added to the design are always given the Stitching setting as they are added. Vias added to traces are not. When you add a via to a trace segment or trace corner, the result is a plain via (unglued). For more information, see "Adding Vias to an [Existing](#page-66-0) Trace".

You can prevent the deletion of stitching vias during ECO operations such as Delete Component, Delete Connection, and Delete Pin, as well as during a Change Part or an Unroute operation. To preserve stitching vias select the Keep Stitching Vias check box in the Group Editing area on the Options dialog box > Design categoryon page 1503.

- 2. Press the Delete key. A dialog opens with the message, "Delete all orphaned vias?". Click **Yes** to delete the stitching via.

#### Converting Routing Vias into Stitching Vias
Vias that you add to a trace segment, corner, or end point, are not considered stitching vias but routing vias. Like stitching vias, you can use these routing vias to interconnect areas of a net, but SailWind Layout does not consider them plain vias. Enable the Stitching setting to make a routing via into a stitching via.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or multiple vias.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. Select the Stitching check box.

### Adding a Test Point to an Existing Trace
You can manually add a test point along an existing segment or trace of a route. Test points, by default, do not glue in a design. You can access them from the bottom.

**Tip** You can also make an existing via, pin or virtual pin a test point. See the Test Point check box in the following object Properties dialog boxes: Via Properties Dialog Box, Pin Properties Dialog Box, Jumper Pin Propertieson page 1422

**Procedure**

- 1. Unless the via used in the design can also be used for test points, create a viaon page 329 to use as a test point.
- 2. If there is more than one via available to the design, you must specify the via that should be used for test points.
	- a. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item.
	- b. In the DFT Audit dialog boxon page 1273, select the Add Test Points to Existing Traces check box. This check box must be selected to choose a test point in the Use Test Point Via list, but is not required to be active to add test points to traces in SailWind Layout.
- 3. Use one of the following methods to add a test point:
- Object mode Select a trace segment or corner. You cannot use multiple selection when adding test points to a route. Right-click and click the **Add Test Point** popup menu item.
- Verb mode On the Design Toolbar, click the **Add Test Point button**. Select any trace segment or corner to which you want to add a test point. Repeat or right-click and click **Cancel**  to exit Add Test Point mode.
- 4. A test point is added to the route.

If you try to add a test point in an area defined as a test point keepout area and DRC mode is set to Prevent Errors, the message "Test point keepout violation" appears and the test point is not added.

### Deleting a Via
You can remove a via by selecting it and pressing the Delete key.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the via.
- 2. Press the Delete key. The via is deleted and the layers of the attached segments are changed if necessary.

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_71_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Note:** If you try to modify route objects in a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse objects cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the editing operation.

### Gluing a Via
Glue a via to prevent it from being moved for any reason.

You can fix a via's location to establish it as a test point on the fabricated board. The points of a bed of nails test apparatus are matched to the test point locations. So if you redesign and remanufacture the board, the glued test points prevent the vias from moving in the new design, thus preventing costly retooling of the test equipment.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a via, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the Glued check box.
- 3. Click **OK**.

**Results**

If you also select the Test Point check box, you include the via's location in a report file in a Test Point section. The Test Point check box also indicates if the via was automatically installed and glued as a test point by an autorouter. Installing test points this way returns test points from the router with checked Glue and Test Point check boxes.

### Deleting Miters
A miter is a diagonal segment or arc that replaces a corner. You can delete all miters from one or more routed pin pairs, drafting paths, or polygons.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the routed pin pairs, drafting paths, or polygons.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Delete Miters** popup menu item. All miters in the selected path are deleted and replaced by a 90-degree corner.

### Deleting a Route from a Pin Pair
You can delete all traces and vias in a routed pin pair.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the pin pair.
- 2. Press the Delete key. A ratsnest line between the two pins replaces the routed pin pair.

### Connecting SMD Pads to Planes
Routing an SMD pad to a plane involves placing a via to the plane under or somewhere near the pad.

Vias you add to plane nets receive a thermal relief pad for the plane layer based on the either the design rules or the pad stack. For more information, see "Design Rule Versus Pad Stack - Thermals and Antipads"on page 797.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have created a via type for use with your design. For more information, see "Creating a Through-hole Via Type", and "Creating a Partial Via Type".
- The via must be available for use, and both source and destination layers must be available for routing according to the applicable Routing Ruleson page 1666.

**Procedure**

- 1. Optionally, if you are fanning out power and ground connections, you can hide all unrouted connections except the power and ground nets and give the pads of those nets unique colors to quickly identify them in the design:
	- a. Click the **View > Nets** menu item.
	- b. Select "Default" in the View List list.
	- c. Select the "Traces Plus the Following Unroutes" check box, if necessary, and in the View Unroutes Details area, click **None**.
	- d. In the Select By list, click Plane Nets. Locate your plane nets in the Net List and add them to the View List.
	- e. Select the plane nets and in the View Unroutes Details area, click "All Except Connected Plane Nets". This shows full pin-to-pin connections and partially routed copper traces, but not partial connections.
	- f. Select each plane net individually and in the Color by Net area, give each net a unique color.

g. Click **OK**.

All the unrouted connections from the display except for the plane net connections are visible and the pads of those nets have unique colors. These turn off as you link them to the plane with vias.

- 2. Add a via using one of the following methods:
	- Fanout via:
		- i. Route a small trace segment out from the pad.
		- ii. While routing, right-click, point to **End Via Mode**, and then click the **End Via** popup menu item to set the mode.
		- iii. Right-click and click the **End** popup menu item to end the trace with a via. The trace ends with a Via. If there is a plane area on the path of the via, it will either connect with a thermal connection if necessary or add an antipad if it should not connect.
	- Via in pad:
		- i. In the Clearance Rules Dialog Box, in the Same Net area, the SMD to Via clearance must be 0 (zero) at the required level of the rules hierarchy to enable the via to be placed in the pad.
		- ii. Select the pad, right-click and click the **Add Via at SMD** popup menu item. The via is added to the center of the SMD. Component pads always overlay vias and it may be difficult to determine if the via is actually inside the pad. Enable Transparent mode with the T modeless commandon page 83 to see vias in pads.

**Results**

When you install the via, either under the pad or a short distance away, the connection for that pin-to-pin unroute connection disappears if you route the connection to the plane layer. For more information, see "Check the Plane Connection for Continuity."

Converting a Trace to a Copper [Chamfered](#page-74-1) Path Restoring Traces After [Conversion](#page-75-1) to Copper Chamfered Paths [Adding](#page-75-0) a Via Shield

### Converting a Trace to a Copper Chamfered Path
Converting traces to a copper chamfered path has two advantages over simply creating a copper chamfered path. You can use the more powerful interactive router to initially route the trace, and when you convert the trace to a chamfered path, SailWind Layout assigns the net automatically.

**Procedure**

1. Select a pin pair, multiple pin pairs, or a net.

Unrouted or partially routed pin pairs, or pin pairs belonging to reuse blocks, are excluded from selection.

2. Right-click and click the **Convert to Chamfered Paths** popup menu item.

Alternatively, you can click under the RF Toolbar.

3. In the Convert Pin Pairs to Chamfered Paths dialog box, select the pins pairs desired using Ctrl +click, Shift+click, or the **Select All** and **Unselect All** buttons as shortcuts.

Only the pins pairs selected in the design appear in the Selected pin pairs list.

4. In the Conversion parameters area, in the Polygon outline width box, type a width value for the width of the copper outline.

Since copper is created with an outline and a fill, you can specify a very narrow outline width to achieve very sharp corners. Decrease the value for sharper corners and increase the value for more blunt corners. All corners are rounded with a radius equal to one half of the outline width.

- 5. Specify a trace width using one of the following:
	- Select the "Use trace width" check box to use the trace width as the width of the chamfered path. Where multiple trace widths exist, the actual trace widths are used. The Selected trace widths value at the top of the Conversion parameters area displays the range of trace widths of the items in the Selected pin pairs list.
	- Clear the "Use trace width" check box and enter a value in the Converted path width box.
- 6. In the Corner chamfer width ratio box type a value specifying the ratio of the chamfered corner width to the chamfered path width.

For example, if the ratio is 1.0, the width of the chamfered corner is the same as the chamfered path. Reduce the radio for a more narrow chamfered corner.

7. Specify the degree of corners to chamfer using one of the following:

- Clear the "Chamfer corners with angles less than or equal to" check box to chamfer only angles less than 90 degrees (acute angles).
- Select the "Chamfer corner with angles less than or equal to" check box to specify an angle between 90 and 180 degrees as the upper limit beneath which all angles are chamfered. Outside corners less than 90 degrees are always chamfered.
- 8. Click **OK**. The trace is converted to a chamfered path and original trace segments are unrouted. Existing vias are retained and are glued.

**Related Topics**

Creating Copper Chamfered Paths

Restoring Traces After [Conversion](#page-75-1) to Copper Chamfered Paths

Drafting Object Properties

### Restoring Traces After Conversion to Copper Chamfered Paths
Converting original traces to copper unroutes the traces. You must re-route traces to replace chamfered paths.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use the Select Nets selection filter to select the net.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Chamfered Paths** popup menu item.

Alternatively, you can click under the RF Toolbar.

3. Press the Delete key.

Vias in the chamfered path are not deleted since they are glued during conversion from trace to chamfered path.

4. Re-route the pin pair, pin pairs, or net.

### Adding a Via Shield
A via shield is a collection of stitching vias that surround a routed net, pin-pair or copper area. You might use a via shield, for example, to surround a net in order to limit noise susceptibility.

For example:

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_76_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Procedure**

1. If you have not done so, set the options for shielding on the Options dialog box > Via Patterns categoryon page 1556.

If you need to create a new via type for shielding, see "Via Setup". Your Via Pattern settings are stored for future operations. You need to perform this step only if you want to change the settings you selected previously.

2. Select a net, pin-pair or copper area.

To add a via shield around a differential pair, first set the filter mode to either Net or Pin-Pair. Then select the two nets or two pin-pairs that make up the differential pair and add a via shield around them. For example:

![](/layout/guide/32/_page_76_Picture_7.jpeg)

The shielding operation applies a shield to each net; therefore, unwanted vias may appear between differential pair traces. If this result happens, you would need to delete those vias.

3. Right-click and click the **Add Via Shield** popup menu item.

Alternatively, you can click under the RF Toolbar.

**Results**

Vias are placed around the selected net, pin-pair, or copper. If there is adequate room for the vias, but no vias appear, your View > Nets menu item, View Details setting on page 1786 could be set to not show Traces Plus the Following Unroutes.

If the Design Rule Checking setting is Prevent Errors, the Add Via Shield operation does not add any via that violates design rules.

When you edit traces, SailWind Layout does not update the pattern of vias in the via shield. After editing traces, you may need to add the via shield again. If that is the case, delete the old via shield before adding the new one.

### Modifying Trace Segment Properties
In the Trace Properties dialog box, view trace segment information, modify the coordinates, specify the trace width, or change the layer on which the segment resides.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the trace segment, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Trace Properties Dialog Box, modify the settings, if necessary.

If you change the layer, vias are automatically added at the segment endpoints. If you select another trace segment while the dialog box is open, the information is updated for the selected segment. Several of the options in this dialog box are unavailable if the trace is part of a physical design reuse.

3. Click **OK**.

## Troubleshooting Constraints While Routing
When you are routing and the design rules constrain you, you can view the rule hierarchy to which the object is subjected and access the rules for a design object (class, net, group, pin pair, component, or unroute). You can do so by selecting the object in the design and displaying its rules.

For example, if there are specific rules defined for the pin pair associated with the unrouted connection, the Pin Pair Rules dialog box appears.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object whose rules you want to display.
- 2. Unless you are already selecting a pin pair or net, right-click and click the **Select Pin Pair** popup menu item.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 4. In the Pin Pair Properties Dialog Box, in the Rules Data area, view the level from which the Pin Pair is getting the design rules.
- 5. Click the **Rules** button to access the Pin Pair level of design rules.

If you need to access a different level of the hierarchy, close all open dialog boxes and click the **Tools > Rules** menu item.

## Clearance and Checking After Routing
*Trace Clearance* is the distance allowed between a trace edge and the edge of another conducting item. You can run a verification check to find clearance violations.

Assign clearance values in the Clearance Rules Dialog Box. If you have the Advanced Rules Installed Optionon page , you can assign non-default clearances on the pin pair, pin pair group, net class, and all 25 levels of the conditional rules.

Use the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item menu to search the design for clearance violations. Verify Design marks each violation and enables you to center the view on each violation. Verify Design only checks for clearance violations on what you choose to display in the design. If you want to check the entire design for clearance violations, make sure colors are applied to all object and that nothing is invisible in the design. Also bring all design items into view by zooming out to the point where all items are in view.

Setting up clearances for traces, as well as pads and vias, is described in "Design Ruleson page 1821". Checking for errors (spacing errors, airgap errors, and high-speed problems) is discussed in "Verify the Design".
