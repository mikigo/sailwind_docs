## Assigning a Net to Existing Copper or Copper Planes
You can assign a net to copper or a copper plane by selecting a design object with the net already assigned, thus assigning the copper to the net.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the copper shape or copper plane.
- 2. Assign the net using one of the following methods:
	- Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Drafting Properties dialog box, in the Net Assignment area, choose a net from the list of nets in the design.
	- Right-click, and then click the **Assign Net By Click** popup menu item. Click a design object, such as a pin, via, trace, net, copper, or unroute, with the netname you want to assign to the copper.

**Results**

The status bar displays the netname assigned to the copper or copper plane.

## Creating Copper or Copper Planes Based on the Net of an Object
If desired, you can assign a net to a new copper shape or pour area before you start drafting it.

- 1. Select a single design object, such as a pin, via, trace, net, copper, or unroute, on the net you want to assign to the copper.
- 2. Right-click,and click the **Add Copper Area** or **Add Copper Plane** popup menu item.
