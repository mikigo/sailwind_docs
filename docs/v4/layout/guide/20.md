Layout Area Assessment Intelligent Layout

## Layout Area Assessment
Use this feature to automatically place components within the board outline, adhering to the layout rules while minimizing the occupied space. It can be triggered by the following two methods:

### Triggered by Menu Bar
**Prerequisites**

There are unglued components outside the board outline.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **AI> Layout Area Assessment** menu item.
- 2. Configure layout rules, including:
	- **One-sided Layout**  Select this option to enable the single-sided layout.

By default, this option is unchecked for double-sided layout.

- **Allow 45 Degrees**  Select to allow rotating components by 45 degrees.
- **Border Spacing**  Specify the minimum clearance from the component body to the board outline.
- **Max Iteration Number**  Specify the number of algorithm iterations, with an upper limit of 100.
- 3. Add classes to include decals and define spacing rules between classes.
	- a. Add classes: In the Class Decal Name box, type the name of the class, and then click **Add** to add the class name to the Class list.

Select a class name in the Class list, you can also:

- Click **Rename** to rename the class selected in the list with the text in the Class Decal Name box.
- Click **Delete** to delete the selected item.
- b. Include PCB decal types to the class: Select a class in the list, and then choose decals from the Usable list to add to the Selected list.
	- Use Ctrl/Shift for multiple selections.
	- Click **Remove** to move the class from the Selected list to the Usable list.

c. Define spacing rules between classes: In the Spacing Rule of the Same Surface Element area, define the clearance rule between classes by double-clicking the table cell.

4. Click **Run** to perform the layout operation. A hyperlink to the report file appears in the Output window, on the **Status** tab.

During runtime, you can:

- Check both the current and maximum iteration count, as well as area utilization rate in the Status Bar.
- Click the **Cancel** button or close the dialog box to terminate the process, placing components based on the current operating state.
- 5. (Optional) Click the **Save** button to save all settings for the next run.

### Triggered by Right-Click Menu
**Prerequisites**

There are unglued components outside the board outline.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select components for layout. Use Ctrl+click to select multiple non-sequential items, or drag the cursor to select a range of items.
- 2. Right-click and select the **Layout Area Assessment** popup menu.
- 3. Click the board outline or 2D line item to define the layout area outline as prompted.

The selected component is placed based on the options configured in the Layout Area Assessment Dialog Box, except for the maximum iteration number (1 for this case).

## Intelligent Layout
Use the Layout Area Assessment feature for minimal layout area.

**Prerequisites**

- The **AI layout reference data** option is enabled when sending a SailWind Logic netlist using the SailWind Layout Link.
- A board outline must be defined in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **AI> Intelligent Layout** menu item.
- 2. In the Intelligent Layout dialog box, a table lists the intelligent identified component groups along with their layout state and rule set correspondingly.

**Note:** Rule set is not currently supported.

- 3. (Optional) Click the **Rule Setup** button to configure layout options on demand, including:
	- **Allow rotation**  Select to allow rotating components by 90 degrees.
	- **Layout style**  Select the layout style from the drop-down list.
	- **One-sided Layout**  Select this option to enable the single-sided layout.

By default, this option is unchecked for double-sided layout.

• **Key part safety spacing** — Specify the minimum clearance from the intelligently identified key component within a group.

**Tip** TSkip this step t set.

- 4. Click the **Module Analysis** button to initiate the module analysis.
- 5. Click the **Module Layout** button to initiate the layout process.

When the process is completed, the Layout State changes to "Layout completion".

- 6. Click the **Cluster Create** button to create clusters from the component groups.
- 7. Click the **Cluster Layout** button to open the Cluster Placement Dialog Box.
