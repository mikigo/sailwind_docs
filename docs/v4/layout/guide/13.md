**Table 71. SailWind Layout Export Data Formats (continued)**

## Importing an ASCII File
You can import an ASCII file created with previous versions of SailWind Layout.

If your data requires format or other changes, such as the addition of an attribute dictionary, to update your data to the current SailWind release, SailWind Layout makes the updates at the time of import. If the ASCII file contains test points, SailWind Layout removes the test points that are not accessible and lists them in the report file. SailWind Layout preserves physical design reuses when you import an ASCII file.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot import the ASCII file if any of the following conditions is true:
	- The design is in default layer mode and the ASCII file is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup dialog box to change the design to increased layer mode.
	- The ASCII file that has fewer electrical layers than the current design. Use the Layers Setup dialog box to increase the electrical layer count in the design to match the number in the imported ASCII file.
	- Perform 6 ASCII created the ASCII file.
- Improvements in thermal relief definition introduced in PADS 9.2 might cause changes in thermal pad appearance, flooding results and CAM output (for CAM Plane layers) when an ASCII file from a previous version is imported into PADS 9.2 or later. If incompatibilities are found when such a file is imported, a warning prompt is displayed and the incompatibilities are written to the *ascii.err*  file.
- Beginning with PADS 9.0, die parts and flip chips are no longer identified by their family designations (DIE or FLP), but instead by the Special Purpose settings in the General tab of the Part Information dialog boxon page 1590. When you import an ASCII file created by a PADS version previous to 9.0, these Special Purpose settings are automatically set for parts having the logic family DIE or FLP. The part's family designation remains the same.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Import** menu item.
- 2. In the File Import dialog box, select the ASCII Files (\*.asc) file type.
- 3. Browse to the file to import and click **Open**.

**Results**

The file is imported, and import process information is written to *ascii.err* in the *...\SailWind Projects* folder.

Exporting an ASCII File

## Exporting an ASCII File
You can use ASCII files to exchange design data between SailWind Layout and external translators or previous versions of SailWind Layout.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- SailWind Layout does not export to PADS-Perform 6 ASCII format.
- Exporting to older formats will result in the loss of any newer software features not supported by older formats.
- Improvements in thermal relief definition introduced in PADS 9.2 may cause changes in thermal pad appearance, flooding results and CAM output (for CAM Plane layers) when an design is exported from PADS 9.2 or later to a previous version. If incompatibilities are found when the design is exported, a warning prompt is displayed and the incompatibilities are written to the *Powerpcb.Rep* file.
- Beginning with PADS 9.0, die parts and flip chips are no longer identified by their family designations (DIE or FLP), but instead by the Special Purpose settings in the General tab of the Part Information dialog boxon page 1590. With this change, the following changes occur in a design when you export it to an ASCII file of a PADS version previous to 9.0:
	- The Special Purpose settings of any die parts and flip chips are cleared.
	- Die parts and flip chips having a family designation other than DIE and FLP lose their die part or flip chip special purpose and become normal parts.
	- Any normal parts that have the DIE or FLP family designation are treated as die parts or flip chips in the previous PADS version.
- If you are exporting to the format of a release earlier than PADS 9.5, virtual pins in the design are exported as vias.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item.
- 2. On the File Export dialog box, select the ASCII Files (\*.asc) file type.
- 3. Specify the filename to export to and click **Save**.
- 4. In the ASCII Output Dialog Box, check the appropriate check boxes to specify the design sections that you want to write to the ASCII file, or click **Select All**.
- 5. In the Format list, select the format version. (If you want to export to PowerBGA V3.0, use the PowerPCB V3.0 format.)
- 6. In the Units list, select the units to export. If you plan to use the ASCII file for an external translator or another ASCII-reading program, select Current. If you plan to re-import the ASCII file and save it as a *.pcb* database, select Basic. Basic units represent how values are stored in the software. They do not use standard units of measure, but they record precise positioning values for database items.
- 7. If you want to export attributes assumed from higher levels in the attribute hierarchy, select the Parts and Nets check boxes as appropriate.
- 8. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The *.asc* file is created. An export status log fileâ *ascii.err*âand an export report fileâ*Powerpcb.Rep* are created in the *\SailWind Projects* folder. Existing physical design reuse information is retained.

Importing an OLE File

## Importing an OLE File
You can import an OLE file (such as a screenshot) into your design.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

â¢ When you import an OLE file into your design, all OLE objects currently in the design are deleted.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Import** menu item.
- 2. On the File Import dialog box, select the OLE Files (\*.ole) file type.
- 3. Browse to the file to import and click **Open**.
- 4. Click **Yes** in the two prompts that appear.

**Results**

Any existing OLE objects in the design are removed, and the OLE objects in the selected OLE file are imported into the design.

## DXF Format
The DXF format handles database objects differently than ASCII files. DXF does not support physical design reuses. DXF also does not support route protection information; therefore, when you import or export a DXF file, the process removes all route protection information. DXF does, however, store slotted hole information for both import and export. Because jumpers, although not part of the part list, are considered vias, you can export them to DXF.

SailWind Layout does not import DXF files from PowerPCB 1.3 and earlier. Versions before PowerPCB 3.0 do not read the DXF files created by PowerPCB 4.0.

If you import a DXF file that contains an ellipse, or a scaled arc with a radius that is too big for the database, a dialog box appears asking you to enter an approximation error. The approximation error determines how the ellipse/arc will be broken into line segments.

For information on creating objects that properly translate to copper polygons and to avoid creating selfintersecting polygons, see Defining Copper Objects in AutoCAD.

**DXF Messages**

The following are possible DXF messages:

â¢ Warning: Found a self-intersecting copper piece while importing hatched solid. File line: XXXX. Continue process?

The DXF file contains a self-intersecting polygon. File line: XXXX refers to the line where the error occurs. Correct the polygons in the AutoCAD application. For information on creating objects that properly translate to copper polygons and avoiding creating self-intersecting polygons, see Defining Copper Objects in AutoCAD.

â¢ Warning: Board cutout containing point <x,y> intersects existing board cutout containing <x,y>. New cutout not imported from DXF file.

The Overlapping board cutouts are reported as warnings when importing a DXF file. Click **OK** to continue importing or click **Cancel** to cancel.

â¢ Warning: Board cutout containing point <x,y> intersects the board outline. Cutout not imported from DXF file.

The cutouts that overlap the board outline are reported as warnings. Click **OK** to continue importing or click **Cancel** to cancel.

**Defining Copper Objects in AutoCAD**

<span id="page-8-1"></span>To define an object in AutoCAD that properly translates to a copper polygon, create a closed polyline that does not self-intersect and assign a solid hatch type. If you create a polygon in this way, it converts to a copper polygon in SailWind Layout \(Figure 24\). In addition, the copper polygon is created in SailWind Layout so that the outside edges of the polygon are aligned with the edges of the shape in AutoCAD, ensuring the entire shape is dimensioned and checked correctly. The following graphic demonstrates this conversion.

**Figure 24. Copper Object with Closed Polygon (Solid Hatch Type)**

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-8-2"></span>If you create a polygon without hatching in AutoCAD, the polygon converts to a 2D line in SailWind Layout \(Figure 25). In this case the centerlines of the 2D line are aligned with the edges of the shape in AutoCAD. The following graphic demonstrates this conversion.

**Figure 25. Copper Object with Closed Polygon (No Hatching)**

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_8_Figure_7.jpeg)

**DXF Export of Filled Polygons**

Filled copper polygons export as polylines with a solid hatch.

**Legacy Layer Mapping**

The following is a cross-reference of the DXF layer names used in the various releases of PADS products. We don't recommend you try to bring an old DXF file into a new release of SailWind Layout.

## Importing DXF Files
You can import DXF files of the AutoCAD 2004 DXF format.

There are two interfaces to import DXF files. This procedure uses an interface designed for advanced import of any and all design objects. It imports the design objects from specially named block and layers names in AutoCAD. This mapping is hard-coded and cannot be changed.

If you need to simply import RF shapes into the decal or into the design, use the procedure given in Importing RF Shapes in DXF Format.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

â¢ You cannot import a DXF file to a design if the design is in default layer mode and the DXF file is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup dialog box to change the design to increased layer mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Import** menu item.
- 2. In the File Import dialog box, in the file type list, select DXF Files (\*.dxf).
- 3. Browse to the file to import and click **Open**.
- 4. In the DXF Import Dialog Box, in the Layer Selection area, select layers from which to import information.

To add individual layers, select the layer names in the Available list and click the **Add** button. To remove individual layers, select the layer names in the Selected list and click the **Remove** button.

- 5. In the Select Input Items area, check the appropriate check boxes to specify the items that you want to import, or click **Select All**.
- 6. In the DXF-File Unit list, select the units to use in the DXF file. This list is unavailable if it is not necessary to set the units.
- 7. In the Mode Area, click an import mode.
- 8. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The *.dxf* file is imported and opened in SailWind Layout.

Line styles imported in the DXF file are matched with the five SailWind Layout line styles. When a line style does not resemble any of the SailWind Layout line styles, a solid line is created.

If your imported geometries have been imported as multiple line items, and you want to convert them to single objects, use the procedures listed in Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapesto do this.

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Nets bridged with copper are not supported in the *.dxf* file format. If you are importing a file previously exported with bridged coppers, they will be imported as regular copper shapes.

DXF Format

## Exporting DXF Files
You export DXF files to transfer design elements to AutoCAD. For example, you can export component height information with the design in order to create a 3D model.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- The *.dxf* file version exported is in version 12 format.
- Nets bridged with copper are not supported in the *.dxf* file format and are exported as regular copper shapes.
- Although 2D lines are drawn with a round pen in SailWind Layout, they are squared (not rounded) in DXF.
- Also, many DXF software tools display patterns of styled lines as hollow and not filled.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the **File** menu click **Export**.
- 2. In the File Export dialog box, in the Save as type list, select "DXF Files (\*.dxf)".
- 3. Browse to overwrite a file, or type a new file name. Click **Save**.
- 4. On the "DXF Export dialog box"on page 1338, in the Export Type area, choose between standard and flat output.

If you select flat output, setup of DXF drill sizes and symbols is unavailable, and 2D Line styles (dash, dotted, dash-dotted, dash-double-dotted) are converted to solid lines.

- 5. In the Layer Selection area, move the layers you want to export information from to the Selected list.
- 6. In the Select Input Items area, check the items that you want to export, or click **All Items**.
- 7. In the DXF-File Unit list, select the units to use in the DXF file. The list is unavailable if it is not necessary to set the units.
- 8. If you are exporting a standard file, perform the following steps if you want to define DXF drill sizes and symbols:
	- a. Click **Setup**.
	- b. In the Setup DXF Drill Size and Symbols dialog box, to specify a drill size for a 2D line library item, click **Add**, type a value into the Drill Size box, and then type the library item name into the Library Equivalent box.

If you do not associate a drill size to a 2D line library item, the default drill symbol is exported for that item.

- c. To remove a drill size for a 2D line library item, select the item in the Drill Size and Library Equivalent area, and then click **Delete**.
- d. If you want to change symbol units, select the units from the System Units list.
- e. If you want to change the appearance of the default drill symbol, which appears in the DXF file as a plus sign +, type the length/width of the plus sign in the Symbol Size box, and then type the plus sign line width in the Line Width box.
- f. Click **OK**.
- 9. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The *.dxf* file is created.

**Related Topics**

## Specifying DXF Drill Sizes and Symbols
Use the "Setup DXF Drill Size and Symbols" dialog box to specify drill sizes for 2D line library items that you export to DXF.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item. Save as DXF type and in the Export dialog box click **Setup**.
- 2. If you want to specify a drill size for a 2D line library item, click **Add**, type a value into the Drill Size box, and then type the library item name into the Library Equivalent box.

If no drill size is associated to a 2D line library item, the default drill symbol is exported for that item.

- 3. If you want to remove a drill size for a 2D line library item, select the item in the Drill Size and Library Equivalent area, and then click **Delete**.
- 4. If you want to change symbol units, select the units from the System Units list.

5. If you want to change the appearance of the default drill symbol, which appears in the DXF file as a plus sign +, type the length/width of the plus sign into the Symbol Size box, and then type the line width of the plus sign into the Line Width box.

6. Click *OK*.

Exporting IDF Files

## Exporting IDF Files
You can create IDF files to export board outlines, keepouts, components, and holes to a mechanical design system.

**Tip**

For a more accurate IDF export, set any IDF-specific part height, drilled hole, and part outline information before exporting. For more information, see"Setting IDF-Specific Part Height  Information for IDF Export", "Adding IDF-Specific Drill Hole Information for IDF Export", and "Defining IDF-Specific Part Outlines for IDF Export".

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item.
- 2. On the File Export dialog box, select the IDF Files (\*.emn, \*.emp) file type.
- 3. Specify the file to export and click **Save**.
- 4. On the IDF Export Dialog Box, in the Shape Layer list, select the layer containing the outline  informationon page 302 for the decals in your design that you want to send to the mechanical design system.
- 5. In the Format list, select the IDF version to use.
- 6. In the Select Export Items area, check the items that you want to export, or click **All Items**.
- 7. Specify the minimum height of components you want to export by typing the minimum part heights in the Top and Bottom boxes. Components less than these heights are not exported. If a part is not exported because of a minimum height value, a message is written to the status log file.
- 8. If the Geometry.Height attribute for any exported part type and decal pairs does not exist or is set to zero, the Missing Height dialog box appears for each pair. If you want to specify height information prior to exporting the part type and decal pair, type the height into the Height box.

If you do not specify the height (or specify it as zero), the mechanical design system may prompt you to enter a height when importing the IDF files.

**Tip**

If you want to apply the height for all part type and decal pairs, select the For All Parts check box.

**9. Click OK.**

**Results**

The *.emn* (board and placement) and *.emp* (part library) files are created. A status log file is written to *C: \SailWind Projects\idfexport.sts*.

## Defining IDF-Specific Part Outlines for IDF Export
For a more accurate IDF export, create any IDF-specific part outlines before you export to IDF. The IDF library file requires part outline information for all parts.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item.
- 2. Open the decal for which you want to define an outline.
- 3. Click the layer on which to define the outline. For IDF, you must use the same layer in each decal to define all part outlines.
- 4. Define the part outline. The outline must be a single, special kind of closed curve that is either a circle or a sequence of non-self-intersecting arcs and contiguous line segments.
- 5. Save the decal.

**Related Topics**

[Part Outline Information \[SailWind Layout Command Reference Manual\]](../../sailwindlayout_cmd_ref/topics/Concept_PartOutlineInformation_id380bca39.html)

## Adding IDF-Specific Drill Hole Information for IDF Export
For a more accurate IDF export, use the HOLE part attribute to set any IDF-specific drill hole information for single-pin parts before you export to IDF. (Vias and multiple-pin parts, even though they appear as drilled holes in the mechanical design system, do not use the HOLE attribute.)

Mechanical design systems interpret drill holes as board drills.

**Procedure**

## Exporting ODB++ Files
You can export an entire design to an ODB++ job, which you transfer from computer to computer without any loss of data.

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_21_Picture_11.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

ODB++ export is based on the CAM documents generated from your design.

- If you have not generated CAM documents and proceed without them, the software generates a set of CAM documents using default configurations and uses them for the ODB++ export. The resulting auto-generated CAM documents may be different than what you would create.
- A warning appears if you inadvertently duplicate one or more layers during the process of creating CAM documents.

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_21_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** Virtual pins in the design are exported as vias.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item.
- 2. In the File Export dialog box, select the location for the job from the Save in list.
- 3. In the Save as type list, select ODB++ (\*.tgz).

If you have copper planes that are not flooded, they are flooded automatically when the CAM documents are being generated.

If you have not created all the required CAM documents for your design you are prompted with a list of missing documents. You can cancel the operation and create those documents, or you can continue and use CAM documents created using default settings.

If you have not created any of the required CAM documents for your design you are prompted to generate the default documents.

- 4. Make appropriate setting changes in the ODB++ Export Dialog Box.
- 5. Click **Save**.

**Results**

The ODB++ job, consisting of a *.tgz* file and associated report file (*\_odbppExport.rep*), is created and placed in the location indicated in step 2. For example, if your file is *preview.pcb*, the resulting files will be *preview.tgz* and *previewodbpp\_Export.rep* in the same directory.

## Exporting CCE Files

## The IPC-D-356 Netlist
The IPC-D-356 netlist format describes the netlist in terms of X, Y locations, which is the format required for testing bare boards.

The IPC-D-356 format is an ASCII format in machine readable form which contains the X,Y locations of points of connectivity of nets, ensuring that the resulting printed circuit board is not only manufactured correctly, but is correct to the original design.

Prior to the IPC-D-356 netlist, ASCII file output was the only file output. This output described connectivity between pins by their reference designators. However, machines require coordinates and CAM outputs consisted of artwork files only. Connectivity could be discovered based on the layer stackup of the artwork, but it could never be checked against the original design.

The IPC-D-356 netlist includes net names, reference designators, and pin numbers. This is not required to test connectivity between coordinates, but it produces results which are easier to understand.

You can also use the updated IPC-D-356A format, which is an updated revision to the D-356 netlist format. The revision A format has more features and is an improvement on the original D-356 format.

## Exporting an IPC-D-356 Netlist
You can export either an IPC-D-356 netlist or an IPC-D-356 Revision A netlist.

![](/layout/guide/13/_page_23_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Warning:**

Nets bridged with copper are combined when you export the design into the *.ipc* (IPC356) file format.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Export** menu item.
- 2. In the File Export dialog box, in the Save as type list, select IPC356 Files (\*.ipc).
- 3. Browse to overwrite a file or type a new file name. Click **Save**.
- 4. In the IPC Export Dialog Box, select one of the two netlist formats.
- 5. Click **OK**. The *.ipc* file is created.
