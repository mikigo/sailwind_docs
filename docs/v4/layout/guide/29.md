## Creating a Copper Shape
Copper is used to create heat sinks, shielding, and net bridges. You can assign nets to copper shapes.

**Prerequisites**

- Ensure you select a layer for placement of the copper. You cannot create a copper shape on all layers (layer number zero). If you need the same copper shape on many layers, copy the shape to other layers.
- Copper must be created with On-Line Design Rule Checking in the Off mode since copper objects cover any and all other electrical objects. If you need a copper shape that avoids objects other than the net to which it is assigned, use a copper plane. For more information, see "Creating a Copper Plane Manually"on page 667.

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper** button.
2. Right-click and click a command to change the values of the drafting object. For more information, see "Set Values Before Creating a Drafting Object" on page 614.
3. Create the shape using one of the following:
	- Creating a Circle Drafting Object
	- Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object
	- Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object
4. Once you complete the shape, it becomes a filled shape, and the Add Drafting Properties dialog box appears.

**Tip**

If you do not want the Add Drafting dialog box to appear when completing the copper, clear the "Prompt for Net Name at Completion of Copper" check box in the Options dialog box > **Text and Lines** category.

5. In the Add Drafting properties dialog boxon page 1328, you can make changes to the copper properties.

For example, in the Net Assignment area, you can assign a net by selecting the net name in the Net list or you can click the **Assign Net by Click** button and click a design object attached to the net. For more information, see "Drafting Object Properties"on page 637.

Is the resulting shape what you expected?

- If the fill is not correct, see "The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes" on page 617.
- If the shape edges are not correct, see "Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615".
- If the shape needs to be modified, see "Drafting Object Properties".
- If you want to start over, see "Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object".

## Creating Copper Chamfered Paths
Because some designs (such as RF designs) require specialized trace corner geometries, you can add chamfered copper as an alternative for regular traces. Using Chamfered Path, SailWind Layout squares or chamfers orthogonal corners. SailWind Layout also chamfers wide angle corners and acute corners.

As copper is created with an outline and a fill, you can specify a very narrow outline width to achieve very sharp corners. SailWind Layout creates all Chamfered Paths with a Solid Copper fill.

**Prerequisites**

This feature requires the Advanced Editing/RF license optionon page .

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper** button.

If you have Online Design Rule Checkingon page 461 enabled, in the prompt that appears, click **OK** to switch off Design Rule Checking.

2. Right-click and click the **Chamfered Path** popup menu item.
3. In the Add Chamfered Path dialog box, set the Chamfered Path Parameterson page 658 and then click **OK**.
4. Click to start the copper.
5. Move the pointer, then do one of the following:
	- Click to place a corner.
	- Type S<x>, <y>, where <x> and <y> are the coordinate values for the next corner.
	- Type SR<x>, <y> if you want to specify relative coordinate values.

**Tip** Right-click and click **Add Arc** to add an arc instead of a straight-line segment.

6. Continue adding copper and corners as necessary.

**Note:**

To back up and remove the last corner, press the Backspace key.

7. To end the copper, either double-click or right-click and click the **Complete** popup menu item.
8. In the Properties dialog box, you can assign a net and modify other settings.

**Results**

If you create a chamfered path pin pair, unroutes will update when you add the copper in the same way as a trace is placed between pads - from and to the center (or Pin Position) of the pads and when you assign the net to the copper. You can also convert traces to chamfered copper paths which automatically assigns the net and unroutes would also update with the original trace connection. see "Converting a Trace to a Copper Chamfered Path".

![](/layout/guide/29/_page_2_Picture_21.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

The chamfered path does not appear as the correct width if the "Minimum display width" option for the design is larger than the Polygon outline width of the path. The path appears more narrow by the value of the Polygon outline width.

Restoring Traces After Conversion to Copper Chamfered Paths

## Setting Chamfered Path Parameters
The Add Chamfered Path dialog box opens when you select Chamfered Path - copper shape. Set the Chamfered Path parameters before you add the copper to the design.

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper** button.

If you have Online Design Rule Checkingon page 461 enabled, in the prompt that appears, click **OK** to switch off Design Rule Checking.

2. Right-click and click the **Chamfered Path** popup menu item.
3. In the Polygon outline width box, type a width value for the copper outline.

![](/layout/guide/29/_page_3_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** Since copper is created with an outline and a fill, you can specify a very narrow outline width to achieve very sharp corners. Decrease the value for sharper corners and increase the value for more blunt corners. All corners are rounded with a radius equal to one half of the outline width.

4. In the "Chamfered path width" box, type a width value for the overall width of the copper path.
5. In the "Corner chamfer width ratio" box, type a value specifying the ratio of the chamfered corner width to the chamfered path width.

If the ratio is 1.0, the width of the chamfered corner is the same as the chamfered path. Reduce the ratio for a more narrow chamfered corner.

6. Clear the "Chamfer corners with angles less than or equal to" check box to chamfer only angles less than 90 degrees or select the "Chamfer corners with angles less than or equal to" check box to specify an angle between 90 and 180 degrees as the upper limit beneath which all angles are chamfered.

Outside corners less than 90 degrees are always chamfered.

7. Click **OK**.

## Bridging Nets with Copper
You can create a physical connection between objects of two different nets with design rule checking enabled.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You can not create bridge copper in the decal.
- Bridge copper saved to the library loses its bridge status.

**Procedure**

1. Use one the following methods.
	- If the copper already exists, select the copper shape, and then right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
	- If the copper does not already exist, Create the copper shape.on page 655
2. In the Add Drafting or Drafting Properties dialog boxon page 1328, select the "Bridge" check box.
3. Click the **Nets to bridge** button.
4. In the Net Association dialog boxon page 1486, add two or more nets to bridge from the "Available nets" list.
5. Click **OK** in the Net Associations dialog box.
6. Click **OK** in the Add Drafting dialog box.

**Results**

You can use this copper to bridge objects of the assigned nets without getting an online design rule checking error. The following exceptions will apply:

- When you run a connectivity check, it will only report an error if no physical connection exists between the bridge copper and a net associated to it.
- When you run a clearance check, it will only report an error if you use any non bridge-copper object to bridge the nets. This is also prevented by online DRC.

You can use the Find Dialog Boxto search for Nets with bridges. Results display the nets and list the bridge coppers associated with them.

You can copy bridge coppers and they retain their bridge status, but their net associations are removed. For more information, see "Copied Bridge Copper in ECO Mode"on page 840.

![](/layout/guide/29/_page_4_Picture_19.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Bridged nets are combined when you export the design into the *.hyp* (PADS HyperLynx), *.ipc*  (IPC356), and *.tgz* (ODB++) file formats.

## Assigning a Unique Netname to Copper or Copper Planes
You can assign a unique netname to copper or copper planes, enabling you to assign rules and properties to the copper shape independent of the netlist.

**Tip** To assign an existing netname to a selected copper shape, use the Drafting Properties Dialog Box.

**Procedure**

1. Select a shape, right-click, and then click the **Add Net** popup menu item.
2. In the Define Name of New Net Dialog Box, do one of the following:
	- To specify a custom netname, choose the Typed New Name option and type the netname in the Name of New Net box. The maximum netname length is 47 characters. You can use any alphanumeric characters except braces { }, asterisks \*, spaces, question marks, or commas.
	- Choose the Autogenerated New Name option to use the default netname.

**Results**

The new name is added to the netlist, and you can access the net in the rules dialogs to add constraints to the new net. Because this action does not affect the schematic logic, the new netname is not recorded as an ECO operation.

## Creating a Copper Cut Out
Use copper cut outs to create voids inside copper shapes. Creating a cut out involves combining the fixed copper shape with the copper cut out.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

A cut out does not create a void in the outline of the copper shape. Create the copper as a polygon shape to create features in the outline.

**Prerequisites**

You must put the cut out on the same layer as the copper.

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper Cut Out** button.
2. Create one or more cut out areas for the copper.

See "Creating a Drafting Object" for more information. You can create the cut out before the copper or the copper before the cut out.

3. Right-click and click the **Select Shapes** popup menu item.

**Tip** If you cannot see a cut out within the copper shape, use the **Drafting** tab in the Options dialog box to set the hatch view to No Hatch. See the Hatch options in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > "Hatch and Flood subcategory"on page 1511.

4. Drag a box to group-select the copper and cut out(s).

**Note:** Some circumstances do not allow for dragging a group selection box. Instead, click to select the cut out. Typically, the copper is selected first. Click the Cycle button to cycle to selecting the cut out. If you have multiple cut outs, use Ctrl+click to select the copper then click the **Cycle** button to select another cut out. As you select additional cut outs, previous cut outs do not retain the selection color but remain selected. Finally, Ctrl+click to select the copper.

5. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item. Copper inside the cut out area is automatically removed.

**Results**

Is the result what you expected?

- Do you need to move or edit a cut out? You will need to uncombine it first. see "Uncombining Drafting Objects".
- Do you need to move or edit the copper? Any modifications you make to the copper shape (move, rotate, miter, etc.,) also affect the combined cut out(s).

Cut Outs Absorbed by Copper

## Cut Outs Absorbed by Copper
When you combine coppers and copper cut outs in SailWind Layout and take the design into SailWind Router, if any cut outs cross the copper outline, they are no longer cut outs. Instead, the software absorbs them into the copper shape.

In some cases, copper cut outs are completely enclosed within the confines of a copper shape. If the copper cut out extends beyond the boundaries of the copper shape, however, and you merge the cut out with the copper shape in SailWind Layout (by right-clicking and clicking the **Combine** popup menu item), when you move the design over to SailWind Router, the software "absorbs" it into the outline of the copper shape.

**Figure 78. Absorbed Copper Cut Out**

If the cut out completely divides a copper shape, two or more separate copper shapes may result in SailWind Router.

**Figure 79. Subtracted Copper Cut Outs in SailWind Router**

![](/layout/guide/29/_page_7_Picture_8.jpeg)

Certain other changes take place:

- If you completely cover a copper shape with a cut out then combine the two, taking the design into SailWind Router deletes the copper shape in its entirety.
- SailWind Router removes any copper cut outs that lie outside the boundary of a copper shape.
- If a copper shape has two or more overlapping cut outs within its boundaries, the copper cut outs merge into one shape when you move the design to SailWind Router.

The software generates a report automatically when you open the design, detailing any instances where the software absorbs one or more shapes during the subtraction process.

![](/layout/guide/29/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:**

If SailWind Router is running in the foreground, the link to the report displays in the SailWind Router Output Window. If SailWind Router is running in the background (for example, during an autoroute routine or during Latium Design Verification), the link to the report displays in the SailWind Layout Output Window.

## Creating Nested Copper
You can create a copper shape within another "outer" copper shape. You can do so by creating a copper cut out inside the outer shape, combining it with the outer shape, and then creating the new nested copper shape inside the copper cutout.

**Procedure**

1. In the outer copper shape, Create a copper cut outon page 660 of appropriate size and shape, and combine it with the outer shape.
2. Create the new nested copper shapeon page 655 within the copper cut out.

**Results**

The new nested copper shape displays inside the cut out of the outer shape.
