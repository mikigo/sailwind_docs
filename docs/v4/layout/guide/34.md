## Differences Between Copper Shapes and Copper Planes
There are many differences between copper shapes and copper planes. This topic presents a feature comparison table that explains the differences for understanding when to use one instead of the other.

| Feature                                                                                                                 | Copper<br>Shape | Copper<br>Plane |

\*These features are controlled by settings.

\*\*If you use the "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" setting in the Options dialog box > **Copper Plane** category > **Thermals** subcategory, antipads use the Copper-to-Drill clearance rule rather than the Copper-to-Pad clearance.

## Flooding Copper Planes
Flooding recalculates the copper plane and recreates all clearances for the current obstacles within the plane outline, observing clearance rules. Use Flood if you change clearance rules, or make changes to or within—a copper plane that might create clearance violations.

Flooding fills the copper plane with copper in a hatched or solid patternon page 617, creating isolation areas around copper, traces, and pads that are inside the copper plane but are not part of the same net. It also creates thermal relief connections around pins that belong to the same net.

The flood operation uses the Options dialog box settings in the Copper Planes category > "Hatch and Flood subcategory"on page 1511 and Thermals subcategoryon page 1514, and Gridson page 1537 category, as well as the flood and hatch optionson page 1381.

![](/layout/guide/34/_page_1_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** If you have overlapping outlines on the same layer having the same flood priority, the software cannot determine which one is the obstacle and which one is the standoff around the obstacle. To avoid conflicts, the overlapping or common section is drawn as a non-hatch area.

**Procedure**

1. Use one of the following methods:
	- Flooding a copper plane using select and flood Use this method to select the copper plane and then apply flooding.
		i. Select the copper plane.
		ii. Right-click and click the **Flood** popup menu item.
	- Flooding a copper plane using the Flood button in verb mode Use this method if you have more than one copper plane to flood. You first activate the Flood button in verb mode and then you can sequentially click copper planes and apply flooding.
		i. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Flood** button.
		ii. Select a copper plane to flood.
		iii. Click and flood other copper planes as needed.
	- Flooding a copper plane using the Copper Plane Manager Use this method to apply flooding to all copper planes in the design.
		i. Click the **Tools > Copper Plane Manager** menu item.
		ii. In the Copper Plane Manager Dialog Box, click Flood.
		iii. Select one or more layers having copper planes to flood.
		iv. Click **Start** to start the flood process.
	- Flooding all copper planes in the design by clicking the **Flood All** button on the main toolbar.

![](/layout/guide/34/_page_2_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** To see the plane data in a negative mode, use the C modeless command.

2. Inspect the resulting shape:
	- If the copper plane did not fill, see "Troubleshooting Copper Plane Fills" on page 674.
	- If the copper plane filled, but opened a Thermal Relief Errors Report (*therm.err*), see "Troubleshooting Thermal Results" on page 675.
	- If the gap between the pad and the copper for thermals or antipads is incorrect, see "Customizing Design Rule Thermals" or "Customizing Design Rule Antipads".
- If the fill is not correct, see "The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes" on page 617.
- If the shape edges are not correct, see "Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615".
- If the shape needs to be modified, see "Drafting Object Properties".
- If you want to start over, see "Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object".

For more information, see "Split/Mixed Plane Layers"on page 683.

**Note:**

Online DRC does not prevent you from moving objects in a flooded area. If you do not reflood the area, Verify Design reports errors. If objects within a flooded area were moved, or thermal settings were changed since the original flooding, you need to flood the area again.

Hatching Copper Planes

## Hatching Copper Planes
Hatching refills (with hatch lines) existing poured copper planes for the current session; it does not recalculate the copper plane area.

Each time you open a design file, you must hatch the design; the fill is not saved (you can set the file to hatch automatically each time you open it, however, using the "Autohatch on file load" option in the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes** category > **Hatch and Flood** subcategory. Use Flood if you change clearance rules, or make changes to—or within—a copper plane that might create clearance violations.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• You can only hatch a copper plane that has already been flooded. This converts the pour outline to a hatch outline.

**Procedure**

1. Use one of the following methods:
	- Hatching a copper plane using select and hatch Use this method to select the copper plane and then apply hatching.
		i. Select the copper plane.
		ii. Right-click and click the **Hatch** popup menu item.
- Hatching a copper plane using the Hatch button in verb mode Use this method if you have more than one copper plane to hatch. You first activate the Hatch button in verb mode and then you can sequentially click copper planes and apply hatching.
	i. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Hatch** button.
	ii. Select a copper plane to hatch.
	iii. Click and hatch other copper planes as needed.
- Hatching a copper plane using the Copper Plane Manager Use this method to apply hatching to all copper planes in the design.
	i. Click the **Tools > Copper Plane Manager** menu item.
	ii. In the Copper Plane Manager Dialog Box, click Hatch.
	iii. Click **Start** to start the hatch process.
2. Inspect the resulting shape:
	- If the gap between the pad and the copper for thermals or antipads is incorrect, see "Customizing Design Rule Thermals" or "Customizing Design Rule Antipads".
	- If the fill is not correct, see "The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes" on page 617.
	- If the shape edges are not correct, see "Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615".
	- If the shape needs to be modified, see "Drafting Object Properties".
	- If you want to start over, see "Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object".

**Note:**

Online DRC does not prevent you from moving objects in a flooded area. If you do not reflood the area, Verify Design reports errors. If objects within a flooded area were moved, or thermal settings were changed since the original flooding, you need to flood the area again.

Flooding Copper Planes

## Copper Plane Flood Priorities
To determine which shape should be flooded first, you must set a flood priority to each shape. A shape with a lower priority number will be flooded before an object with a higher priority number. Copper planes on different layers are processed independently.

**Scenario 1**

You have adjacent shapes with a 25mil copper-to-copper clearance rule value.

**Figure 104. Scenario 1 with Same and Different Flood Priorities**

![](/layout/guide/34/_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Scenario 2**

You have an embedded shape within a copper plane.

Flooding Copper Planes

## Setting Flooding Order of Overlapping Copper Planes
The order in which copper planes are flooded will determine how they will appear in the design. You must set a flood order, (called the "priority") for each object to define which copper plane should be flooded first. An object with a lower priority number will be flooded before an object with a higher one. Copper planes on different layers are processed independently.

**Procedure**

1. Right-click and click the **Select Shapes** popup menu item.
2. Select the copper plane.

**Restriction:**

The area you select cannot be a "plane hatch outline"on page 1849.

**Tip**

To quickly give the area the highest priority, bring it to the front (right-click and click the **Bring to front** popup menu item); to give it the lowest priority, send it to the back (rightclick and click the **Send to back** popup menu item).

3. Right-click, then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
4. In the Drafting Properties Dialog Box, click the **Options** button. If the button does not appear, you have selected a hatch outline.
5. In the Flood and Hatch Options Dialog Box, set the flood priority. 0 (zero) is the highest priority (that is, it is flooded first and cannot be flooded over), and 250 the lowest.

![](/layout/guide/34/_page_9_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also see the flood priority number in the status bar as P:<number>, when you select the area.

6. Click **OK** to close all open dialog boxes.

## Plane Thermal Indicators
Plane thermal indicators are graphic images that show the thermal attribute status of pads.

There are two types of plane thermal indicators, general and specific. Sometimes during editing, thermal markers are covered; redraw the screen to view all of the markers.

| Indicator              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Understanding How to Manipulate Copper Plane Thermals and Antipads
This section presents conceptual information that applies to the creation of copper planes and the use of custom thermals.

For procedures to create copper planes, see "Creating a Copper Plane Manually"on page 667 and for custom thermals, see "Creation of Thermals in the Pad Stacks"on page 186.

Common Copper Plane Thermal and Antipad Clearance Scenarios Common Thermal Style Scenarios

### Common Copper Plane Thermal and Antipad Clearance Scenarios
This section discusses the four most common setting-combinations that affect a design's thermal and antipad clearances. Understanding these settings enables you to predictably create the thermal and antipad clearances that you desire.

Default Thermals and Antipads Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads Custom Thermals and Antipads Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals and Antipads and the Use of Design Rules for Thermals and  Antipads

#### Default Thermals and Antipads
There are a number of common settings for the default thermals and antipads. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. Remove Unused Padson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
2. Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipadson page 1514 check box cleared (disabled)
3. No custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
4. No custom antipads defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566

The Remove Unused Pads setting removes the pad from any component pin or via on an inner layer if that pin or via is not thermally tied to the copper plane or there are no routes coming off that pin or via on the plane layer.

Default thermals and antipads use the following basic formulas for calculating the clearance to the drill for antipads and the clearance to the pad for thermals:

- Default component through-hole antipad diameter = (2 x Copper-to-Pad clearance value) + pad size
- Default via antipad diameter = (2 x Copper-to-Via clearance value) + via pad size

**Example:** +5V via in a +12V copper plane with 35 mil pad, 20 mil drill, and 8 mil copper-to-via clearance value would result in a 51 mil diameter antipad, (2 x 8) + 35 = 51. Default copper to pad or copper to via clearance on thermals is simply controlled by the copper-to-pad or copper-to-via values.

**Note:** The drill-to-copper clearance is used when the drill size is larger than the pad size, as defined in the pad stack setup.

The rules hierarchyon page 404 influences the default antipad and thermal clearance sizes. A Net rule with a higher copper-to-pad value than the default rule will create larger antipad sizes and greater clearance on thermals for the pins of that net. A net rule created for the plane net will not affect the antipad clearance size, but will affect the copper clearance on thermals. Net rules for the opposing nets will affect antipad size.

Conditional rules have some special behaviors. A Conditional rule in which a net is set against a layer will utilize the default antipad calculation. However, a Conditional rule in which one net is set against another net will not affect the antipad size unless the "Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads" setting is enabled - see "Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads".

#### Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads
These are a number of common settings for Design Rules for thermals and antipads. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. Remove Unused Padson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
2. Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipadson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
3. No custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
4. No custom antipads defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566

The thermals and antipads are now independently controlled by the Design Rules. This method enables you to create large antipad sizes without affecting the clearance on pads with thermals. The antipad size created affects both vias and component pads.

• Antipad Diameter for component pads and vias = (2 x Copper-to-drill) + Drill size

Thermal clearance is controlled by design rules copper-to-pad and copper-to-via settings. The rules hierarchy influences the default antipad and thermal clearance sizes. A net rule for the plane net affects the antipad size of any opposing net if you adjust the drill-to-copper value.

**Example:** A copper plane is defined for +12v, a net rule for +12v with an increased drill-to-copper value will cause the antipad size to increase for all non-connected pins or vias within the +12v copper plane.

Conditional rules have some special behaviors. A Conditional rule in which a net is set against a layer will utilize the default antipad calculation - see "Default Thermals and Antipads." However, a Conditional rule in which one net is set against another net will not affect the antipad size unless the "Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads" setting is enabled.

#### Custom Thermals and Antipads
Custom thermals and antipads both have some common settings. Familiarize yourself with these settings to determine best which ones to use for accomplishing your design goals.

Setup required:

1. Remove Unused Padson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
2. Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipadson page 1514 check box cleared (disabled)
3. You have custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
4. You have custom antipads defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566

Design rule settings do not affect the custom antipad size you define for the decal(s). The custom pad stack settings determine thermal or antipad clearances as well as any clearance checks.

![](/layout/guide/34/_page_14_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Note:** You must select the Remove Unused Pads check box to enable custom antipad creation.

#### Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals and Antipads and the Use of Design Rules for Thermals and Antipads
There are a number of common settings for establishing the hierarchy between custom thermals and antipads and the use of Design Rules for thermals and antipads. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. Remove Unused Padson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
2. Use Design Rules for Thermals and Antipadson page 1514 check box selected (enabled)
3. You have custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
4. You have custom antipads defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566

All custom antipad settings are ignored on pins and vias. The antipad size are determined by the copperto-drill value in design rules.

• Antipad Diameter for component pads and vias = (2 x Copper-to-drill clearance value) + Drill size

A custom thermal's inner diameter is still used (the actual pad size), however the copper-to-pad clearance is used for component pins and the copper-to-via clearance is used for vias. The outer diameter value from a custom thermal is ignored in favor of the design rules.

### Common Thermal Style Scenarios
This section discusses the three most common situations that affect thermal styles such as orthogonal, diagonal, flood over and no connect. Understanding these situations enables you to predictably create the thermal styles that you desire.

Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options

Hierarchy between Custom Thermals and Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals, Style Changes in the Thermals Options and Flood-over Vias in Copper Planes

#### Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options
There are a number of common settings for changing thermal styles in the Thermals options. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Copper Planes** category > Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
2. No custom thermals are defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
3. The "Flood over vias" check box is unchecked (disabled) in the Flood on page 1381.

The thermal style you choose affects all component pins and all vias for all layers and for all copper planes. You can set different thermal styles for each of the four pad shapes: round, square, oval, and rectangle. You can also differentiate between through-hole and surface mount components.

**For example:** It is possible to have a through-hole round pad with orthogonal spokes and a through-hole oval pad with a flood-over. You could also set up a through-hole round pad to be diagonal while an SMD round pad is set to no-connect.

#### Hierarchy between Custom Thermals and Thermal Style Changes in the Thermals Options
There are a number of common settings for establishing the hierarchy between custom thermals and thermal style changes in the Thermals options. After you become familiar with them, you can determine which settings you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Copper Planes** category > Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
2. You have custom thermals defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
3. The Flood over vias check box is cleared (disabled) in the Flood and Hatch Optionson page 1381.

Settings adhere to those components with custom thermals defined. All other components and/or vias will follow the thermal styles defined in the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory. You can create a flood-over of specific pins or vias by creating a custom thermal and reducing the outer diameter size to be equal to the inner diameter size. You may find this very helpful if, for instance, you only want the two mounting hole pins of your component to flood-over when connecting to GND.

#### Hierarchy Between Custom Thermals, Style Changes in the Thermals Options and Flood-over Vias in Copper Planes
There are a number of common settings for establishing the hierarchy between custom thermals, style changes in the Thermals options and flood-over vias in the copper planes. Once familiar with these settings, you can determine which ones you should use to accomplish your design goals.

Setup required:

1. You have made thermal style changes in the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes**category > Copper Planes / Thermalson page 1514 subcategory.
2. No custom thermals are defined in Pad Stacks Propertieson page 1566
3. The Flood over vias check box is selected (enabled) in the Flood and Hatch Optionson page 1381

Settings adhere to those components with custom thermals defined. For those vias that are within the copper plane in which you specified for "Flood Over Vias," they all flood over, no custom thermals adhere within that copper plane polygon. To set Flood Over Vias, select the copper plane in pour outline mode, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item, click on the **Flood & Hatch Options** button, and in the Flood & Hatch Options dialog box, select the "Flood over vias" check box. The thermal styles defined in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory are adhered to by all remaining components and vias.

## Generating Thermals
Component pins and vias automatically receive thermals if they are associated with a plane net and if they have pads on the associated CAM plane layer. For component pins and vias that receive thermals, the Plane Thermal option is automatically turned on in the Pin Properties dialog box.

- When you unassign a plane net from a plane layer, the thermals are removed for all of the pins in the net. The Plane Thermal option is automatically cleared in the Pin Properties dialog box.
- If during routing you add a via to a plane net, the via automatically receives a plane thermal. The Plane Thermal option is automatically selected in the Via Properties dialog box.

For information on how thermals translate to and from SPECCTRA, see the SPECCTRA Translator Help.

Check the Flood Priorities by selecting the shape, opening the Properties and clicking on the Options button. The Flood Priority numbers should be lowest for inner nested planes and greatest for the outer planes.

**Symptoms of Poor Thermal Results**

Poor thermal connectivity can cause signal integrity problems in your design.

If the following symptoms occur, see "Troubleshooting Copper Plane Fills" on page 674:

- Copper plane will not flood
- Problems with split/mixed planes

## Thermals on CAM Planes
When you generate thermals for CAM plane plots, SailWind Layout looks for plane netnames associated with CAM plane layers. SailWind Layout also checks that pins or vias with pads on the CAM plane layer have the Plane Thermal option selected in the Pin Properties and Via Properties dialog boxes. Use the "Show General Copper Plane Indicators" option in the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes**  category > **Thermals** subcategory to display CAM plane thermals.

When a pin exists in a net that is associated with a CAM plane layer and Plane Thermal is selected for the pin, a thermal appears on the pin. The ratsnest connections still appear. Use plane check in Verify Design to verify thermal generation for CAM plane plots.

**CAM Plane Thermals**

CAM plane thermals are displayed in the work area and the CAM preview area.

These calculations are also used for output during printing, pen plotting, and photo plotting operations:

- The outer diameter of the thermal matches the width of the aperture set in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box.
- The inner diameter is 75% of the outer diameter.
- The number of spokes is always four, arranged diagonally.
- The spoke width is 1/6 of the outer diameter.

**Tip** The inner width for custom CAM plane thermals is set as the pad size defined in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box. The outer width is set as the default same-net pad to corner rule.

**Viewing Plane Layer Connectivity**

For CAM plane layers, the Plane Thermal option determines whether the thermal is generated for the pin. The Plane Thermal option signals CAM output to assign a D-code for a thermal relief aperture around the pins. Set the Plane Thermal option using the Properties dialog boxes for pins, vias, and jumper pins.

If you set up a plane connection successfully, a D-Code number is assigned for a thermal relief pad in your photoplotter aperture table, one that matches each pad size required. For more information, see the Results section of "Creating a CAM Plane Gerber-format File".

## Thermals on Copper Plane Areas
SailWind Layout follows certain procedures for thermals appearing in copper planes.

SailWind Layout looks for the same net name for objects to connect with a copper plane thermal:

- A component pin receives a thermal connection to a copper plane if there is no trace connected to it and the net name of the pin matches the net name of the copper plane.
- A component pin with a trace connected to it may receive a thermal connection if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" check box is selected in the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory.
- During copper plane flooding, vias always get copper plane thermals if the netname of the via matches the netname of the surrounding copper plane, whether they show unroutes or not.

Ratsnets connections still appear after the software pours the copper plane and installs the copper plane thermals. Click the **View > Nets** menu item to open the View Nets dialog box and assign the net to the View list. In the View Details area, select the "Traces Plus the Following Unroutes" check box and set the corresponding option to "All Except Connected Plane Nets. Choose the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item to check connectivity for copper planes.

**Setting Pins and Vias as Thermals**

Jumper pins, pins, and vias can all have thermals. For these objects to be eligible for a thermal, the Plane Thermal check box in the Jumper Pin Properties, Pin Properties, and Via Properties dialog boxes must be enabled.

If you select more than one pin or via where both plane nets and non plane nets are included, and not all pins and vias are marked as eligible for indicators, the Plane Thermal check box is neither selected or cleared but shows is a solid square showing a mixed state. If you click to select Plane Thermal, the selected plane net pins or vias are updated.

**Design Rule Versus Pad Stack - Thermals and Antipads**

There are two ways to apply thermal and antipad settings. One is design-based, and uses the design rule hierarchy to apply the settings. The second is component-based, and uses the pad stacks to customize the thermals and antipads of component pins and vias. You can use a combination of design rule and pad stack thermal and antipad settings.

**Design Rule Thermals and Antipads**

Design rule thermals are defined by the settings of the Thermals Options and the Copper-to-Pad or Copper-to-Via clearance rules. In the Thermals Options you define the spokes, and using the clearance rules, you define the gap between the pad and the copper.

Design rule antipads are defined by the Pad to Copper and Via to Copper clearance rules. You can use the hierarchy of the design rules to create different gaps between the drill and copper of antipads. For example, using the Net level of the Rule hierarchy, you could apply a larger gap to any pad connected to a particular net. Antipads can be defined by the Drill to Copper clearance rule when you select the "Use design rules for thermals and antipad" check box in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory.

You can only apply separate spoke settings to drilled and non-drilled thermals. The spoke settings globally apply to all pads of either type. If you need to customize the spoke settings of individual pads, you should use the pad stack thermal and antipad settings.

**Pad Stack Thermals and Antipads**

The pad stack thermals and antipads offer full control over all aspects of thermals and antipads. Unlike the design rule thermals and antipads, you can control the spokes of individual pads.

If you apply pad stack thermals and antipads to decals in the library, those settings may not apply to different PCB designs. You may want to only apply the pad stack settings to instances of the decal in the design rather than the decal in the library.

**Priority**

Although you can use a combination of design rule and pad stack thermal and antipad settings, the pad stack settings take priority over the more global design rule settings.

**CAUTION:**

Exit SailWind Layout before you edit the *SailWind.ini* file.

**Procedure**

1. In a text editor, open the *SailWindpcb.ini* file. The file's location is:

*C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Settings*

2. Change the VS\_StitchVoids value to 1. For example:

[ViaShield] VS\_StitchVoids=1

3. Restart SailWind Layout.

**Results**

The Via Stitch operation not only places vias inside the perimeter of a shape but also surrounds voids within the shape.
