## Standard Reference Designators
In order to promote continuity across the industry, standardized reference designators have been created for each of the major component and design object types. This topic presents a table containing the standard reference designator definitions from the IPC-2612 standard for schematic symbol generation.

## Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings
You can generate a second set of reference designators, from the components on your board, to place on the Assembly Drawing layers.

For assembly drawings, you typically place the reference designators in the center of the components. But for the silkscreen, you place the reference designators outside the component. Instead of moving the reference designators for the silkscreen gerber file, and the assembly drawings, you create a second set for the assembly drawings. While you can add two sets of reference designators when you create the decal, the following procedure assumes you only have one set of reference designators on the silkscreen layers, placed optimally for the silkscreen.

**Procedure**

1. Select all components on either the top, or bottom layer.

For selection instructions, see "Object Selection." You might need to hide the opposite mounted layer or set your selection filter to select only objects on the one layer.

![](/layout/guide/35/_page_2_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** Use the Z modeless commandon page 83 to hide and reveal specified layers.

2. Right-click and click the **Add New Label** popup menu item.
3. In the Add New Part Label Dialog Box, ensure the Attribute list is set to "Ref.Des".
4. In the Layer list, select either the Assembly Drawing Top or Assembly Drawing Bottom layer.

The layer to which you are moving the labels needs to be set as visible and a non-background color applied to reference designators on that layer in order for you to see the new labels on the layer. For more information, see "Setting Global Colors of Design Objectson page 131."

5. Use the Position and sizes area to move all reference designators to the origin of components.

This is a quick way to center reference designators of surface mount components and any other components whose origin is at the center and not pin 1.

a. In the Position and sizes area, select the Relative to Component check box.
b. In the X and Y boxes, type 0 (zero).
c. In the Justification area, for both Horizontal and Vertical lists, click Center.
6. Click **OK**.
7. You will need to manually center any components with origins not at the center of the component.

Moving Reference Designators to the Silkscreen Layer

## Moving a Reference Designator
As you reposition objects in your design, reference designators may have to be moved so that they remain legible and avoid conflict with other design objects. You can move reference designators to optimize their location on the PCB.

**Procedure**

1. Use one of the following methods to begin moving the reference designator:
	- Object mode Select a reference designator then right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
	- Verb mode On the Design Toolbar, click the **Move Reference Designator** button, then select the reference designator that you want to move.
2. With the reference designator attached to the pointer, click to indicate a new location for the reference designator.

## Moving Reference Designators to the Silkscreen Layer
If your components have been designed with reference designators included on layers other than the silkscreen layer(s) such as Layer Top or Layer Bottom, you can move them to the silkscreen layer(s) in the design.

**Procedure**

1. Select all components on either the top, or bottom layer.

For selection instructions, see "Object Selection." You might need to hide the opposite mounted layer or set your selection filter to select only objects on the one layer.

**Tip** Use the Z modeless commandon page 83 to hide and reveal specified layers.

2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
3. In the Component Properties Dialog Box, click the **Labels** tab.
4. In the Label list, select "Ref.Des".
5. Click the button underneath the Label list.

6. In the Part Label Properties Dialog Box, in the Layer list, select the correct silkscreen layer for the components you have selected at the beginning of this procedure.
7. Click **OK** to move the reference designator labels to the specified layer.
8. Repeat this procedure for labels on the opposite layer.

## Disabling Reference Designators of Selected Components
You can disable the display of the reference designator label for a component. If you turn off the reference designator label, it is also not visible in the CAM outputs for manufacturing the PCB.

This feature could be used to disable the reference designators of mounting holes placed in the design from parts stored in the library. As parts, they have reference designators, but they do not need reference designators to show up in the silkscreen.

![](/layout/guide/35/_page_4_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** You can hide the display of all reference designators by layer using the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box.

**Procedure**

1. Select a reference designator.
2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
3. In the Part Label Properties Dialog Box, in the Show list, click None.
4. Click **OK** and the reference designators label is turned off.
