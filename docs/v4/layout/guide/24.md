## The Virtual Pin
A virtual pin is like a component pin that you can add to a net. It becomes a start point and/or end point of one or more new pin pairs. This gives you increased (sub-pin-pair) control over the net. For example, you could use a virtual pin to create distinct matched length pin pairs out of the net's branches.

**Tip**

You can also add virtual pins in SailWind Router.

A virtual pin uses the pad stack of a via. The pad stack can be through-hole or partial, or it can be a single-layer pad. Virtual pins are added to nets. When you add a virtual pin to a net, the total number of pin pairs in the net increases by 1, as shown in this example:

You can assign rules to pin pairs ending on virtual pins in the same way as to pin pairs ending on component pins.

In the display, virtual pins are identified with a marker that uses the color of the board outline.

To work with virtual pins, you need the Advanced Rules license.

## Virtual Pin Setup
Virtual pins use via types defined in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box.

If you want to create unique via types to use for virtual pins in your design (a non-drilled single-layer pad, for instance) follow the procedures in "Via Setup".

## Adding a Virtual Pin to a Net
You can add a virtual pin to any net—unrouted, partially-routed, or wholly routed.

When you add a virtual pin to a net, it is added as follows:

• If the virtual pin you are adding is the first virtual pin in the net, and the net has no pin pair rules and no routing, and has Minimized topology, pin pairs are created between the new virtual pin and each component pin in the net in a "starburst" pattern, with the virtual pin in the center. This is the only case in which a starburst pattern is created.

Note that if a virtual pin has been previously added to the net and deleted, the net topology will have been set to Protected; so the virtual pin you are adding, even though it appears to be the first virtual pin in the net, will be connected only to the nearest component pin, not in a starburst pattern. You must reset the net topology to Minimized to create the starburst pattern with a central virtual pin.

- If the virtual pin you are adding is the first virtual pin in the net, and the net has pin pair rules, or routing, or a topology other than Minimized, the new virtual pin is connected to the nearest component pin only. No starburst pattern is created.
- If the virtual pin you are adding is not the first virtual pin in the net, it is connected to the nearest virtual pin only. No starburst pattern is created.

**Restriction:**

You cannot create a starburst pattern by placing a virtual pin on a trace of a routed net.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a virtual pin to a plane net.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design area, select a net.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Add Virtual Pin** popup menu item. The new virtual pin appears on the pointer.
- 3. Position the virtual pin, and click to place it. To stop adding virtual pins, right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item.

**Results**

• If you have created a starburst pattern, the new pin pairs are created, and the net topology is set to Protected. If you set your filter to Select Pin Pairs, you can select each connection. The status bar displays the connection to the virtual pin. Instead of a component and pin number (for example U2.8), it displays the instance of the virtual pin (for example VP2). The same format (VP<number>) is used in pin pair names, for example VP7—U2.1.

For information on setting design rules for the new pin pairs, see "Pin Pair Design Rules."

• If you have created a non-starburst configuration, or if you have created a starburst configuration and want to reconfigure your pin pairs, you will need to reschedule the net in SailWind Router. See "Rescheduling Nets" in the *SailWind Router Guide* for instructions.

## Moving a Virtual Pin
Move virtual pins just as you would move a via.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot move more than one virtual pin at a time.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design area with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select a virtual pin to move, right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
- 3. Move the virtual pin to a new position. Virtual pins adhere to the via grid for initial placement but adhere to the design grid when moving them.

## Deleting a Virtual Pin
You can remove or delete a virtual pin from a routed or unrouted connection.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design area with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the virtual pin, right-click, and click the **Delete** popup menu item.

**Results**

- If the deleted virtual pin has only one connection (routed or unrouted), the virtual pin and its connection are deleted.
- If the deleted virtual pin has two or more connections, all unrouted, the virtual pin is deleted, and new connections are made between the component pins and virtual pins it was connected to.
- If the deleted virtual pin has two or more connections, some or all of which are routed:
	- The virtual pin and all its attached pin pairs are deleted.
	- Routing (traces and vias) of the deleted pin pairs remains, and is assigned new pin pairs.
	- If traces from different layers were attached to the deleted virtual pin, one or more zero-length unroutes will be created between junctions on different layers.
	- Unroutes might be connected to junctions that replace the virtual pin.

## Converting a Virtual Pin to a Via
Select a virtual pin in the design and right-click to convert it to a via.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design area with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the virtual pin, right-click and click the **Convert to Via** popup menu item.

**Results**

The virtual pin is converted to a via, traces and unroutes attached to the converted virtual pin remain attached to the new via, and new pin pairs passing through the new via are assigned.

## Gluing a Virtual Pin
Select a virtual pin in the design and enable the Glued property.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design area with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the virtual pin, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Virtual Pin Properties Dialog Box, select the Glued check box.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Changing a Virtual Pin's Via Type**

If desired, you can change the via type that a virtual pin uses by right-clicking on it.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the virtual pin, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Virtual Pin Properties Dialog Box, select the new via type from the Via Name list.
- 3. Click **OK**.

## Support for Export to Other Formats
Virtual pins are recognized and exported when a design is exported to the PADS-ASCII format (of PADS 9.5 or later), or to a DXF file. When a design is exported to any other format, including PADS-ASCII formats of releases earlier than PADS 9.5, the export process converts virtual pins to vias.

For more information, see "File Export Formats".

## ECO Import Support
ECO ignores operations on virtual pins, but in cases of removal of components or connections from nets containing virtual pins, importing the ECO file affects the nets.

Nets are affected as follows when you import the ECO file:

- If, after applying all ECO commands that remove components, connections, or nets, a net is left with less than two component pins, the net and all its virtual pins are deleted.
- If a net with virtual pins is left with two or more component pins, its virtual pins remain, and new pin pairs are created.
- If a net is split at a connection that has a virtual pin, the virtual pin remains connected to one of the new nets.

## Reuses Support
Physical design reuses do not support virtual pins.
