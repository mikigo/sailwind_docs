## SailWind Libraries
The parts, decals, and other items you use to lay out a design in SailWind reside in one or more SailWind libraries.

Libraries store decal and part type attributes and attribute labels, but they do not store attribute values. The following table shows the four kinds of items that can exist in a library.

| Item      | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decal     | The graphical representation of the part when it is drawn. This is often<br>referred to as the footprint.                                                  |
| Part      | Data about a part, including logic family, attributes, pins, and gates. For<br>example, as a 74LS02.                                                       |
| Lines     | Graphical data you can store in the library to use in any design file. For<br>example, a company logo.                                                     |
| CAE Decal | The graphical representation of a schematic part, such as a NOR gate.<br>These items are read-only. Use SailWind Logic to create and modify CAE<br>decals. |

**Table 55. Library Items**

A single SailWind library consists of 4 files, each containing items of a specific type identified by the file's extension, as follows:

| File Extension | File Contents |
|----------------|---------------|
| .pt            | Part Types    |
| .pd            | PCB Decals    |
| .ld            | CAE Decals    |
| .ln            | Line graphics |

|  |  | Table 56. SailWind Library Files |  |  |
|--|--|----------------------------------|--|--|
|--|--|----------------------------------|--|--|

For information on creating CAE decals, see "Creating a New CAE Decal" in the *SailWind Logic Guide*. For information on creating line graphics, see "Adding Drafting Items from a Library" in this manual.

## Conversion of Older PADS Libraries to the Current Format
To support new functionality, the library structure for SailWind Layout and SailWind Logic updates from time to time. When you convert earlier versions to the latest version libraries, they change so they become compliant with the latest software. The conversion changes the file name extension.

For steps detailing how to convert libraries, see the Library Converter Help.

**Tip** If you have libraries from PowerPCB versions 1 or 2 you need to use the library converter in PowerPCB 3.x.

A report file is created listing which libraries converted along with their conversion status (fully converted, converted with n failures, or no conversion possible). For each library the report will list the items that converted with their status (converted OK or failed to convert).

For information on how to convert older PADS libraries to the current SailWind format, see the SailWind Library Converter User's Guide.

## Creating a New Library
When you create a new library, you actually create a blank container for library content and add it to the Library List. After you create this new library, you can then fill it with content.

**Tip** You can also add an existing library - for more information, see "[Adding Libraries to the Library](#page-7-1) [List"](#page-7-1).

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. Click **Create New Lib**.
- 3. In the New Library dialog box, specify the folder and library file name, and then click **Save**.
- 4. Click **Close**.

**Results**

Your library is added to the bottom of the Library list which is also the last library in the [search order](#page-8-0) [on page 145.](#page-8-0) To move your library up in the library list and search order, see "[Setting the Library List](#page-8-1) [Order"](#page-8-1).

## Displaying Items in a Library
Use the Library Manager dialog box to display the items contained in a library.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager Dialog Box, select a library in the Library list or select the (All Libraries) item at the top of the list.
- 3. Click one of these buttons to display categories of items in the library:
	- **Decals**  PCB decals (component footprints)
	- **Parts**  The electrical information that joins with the PCB decal
	- **Lines**  Drafting objects
	- **Logic**  CAE decals (schematic symbols) (Use SailWind Logic to edit CAE decals.)
- 4. An empty filter box yields no results. To filter the list, type [wildcards or expressionson page 155](#page-18-0) in the Filter box. If you do not want to restrict the results with a filter, you can display all items by typing \* (asterisk) in the Filter box.

**5. Click Apply.**

**Results**

Library item names are displayed in the PCB Decals, Part Types, Line Items, or CAE Decals list. (The list name changes based on the Filter you have selected.) The preview window displays a graphic of the library object.

Since library Parts have no visual representation, the preview window displays the first PCB decal associated with the part.

## Modification of Library Data
SailWind Layout provides a wide range of options for modifying your library data to meet your design requirements.

- 1. Follow the steps to [export library data from the libraryon page 151.](#page-14-1)
- 2. Then follow the steps to [import the library data to another libraryon page 151](#page-14-2).

## Library Availability and Search Options
Use the Library List dialog box to specify search-related options such as the library search order and which libraries are available to the design. Operations in this dialog box affect the contents of the Library list in the Library Manager dialog box.

[Adding Libraries to the Library List](#page-7-1) [Removing Libraries from the Library List](#page-7-2) [Library Content and the Search Order](#page-8-0) [Setting the Library List Order](#page-8-1) [Sharing a Library Across a Network](#page-8-2) [Controlling Library Search Access](#page-9-0) [Protecting Library Files](#page-9-1) [Synchronizing with SailWind Logic](#page-9-2)

### Adding Libraries to the Library List
If you want to make a library's contents available, add the library to the library list. The library must be listed in the Library Manager in order to search it and use its parts, decals, or line items in your design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click **Manage Lib. List**.
- 2. In the Library List Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 3. In the Add Library dialog box, specify the folder and file name of the library to add, and then click **Open**.

**Results**

The library is added beneath the currently selected library in the Library list.

### Removing Libraries from the Library List
If you want to prevent a library's contents from being used in a design, remove the library from the library list.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click **Manage Lib. List**.
- 2. In the Library List Dialog Box, in the Library list, select one or more libraries, and then click **Remove**.

![](/layout/guide/6/_page_7_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** The library files are not deleted from the computer.

### Library Content and the Search Order
Parts and decals you create do not have to be located in the same library together. When your part refers to a decal in a different library, SailWind Layout automatically picks up the decal when needed.

If you have multiple library items of one type and with the same name, the first occurrence of the item is chosen when the library is searched.

For example, during import of a schematic netlist, the libraries are searched for an 0603 decal. But there are two, each in a different library. The libraries are searched from the first library in the list, to the last library in the list. The first occurrence found will be selected for use to represent the part in the design.

When you have multiple libraries available, they are processed in their order in the library list whenever the libraries are searched. The libraries are searched during the following procedures:

- Searching for library items using various dialogs
- Importing a netlist from the schematic
- Updating your design from the library
- Annotating your design with new components from the schematic

You can change the search order of libraries using the Library List Dialog Box.

### Setting the Library List Order
You can specify the order in which libraries are searched.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click the **Manage Lib. List** button.
- 2. In the Library List Dialog Box, in the Library list, select the library, and then click **Up** or **Down** as needed.

With each click, the library moves up or down one place in the library list. The libraries are searched top to bottom.

### Sharing a Library Across a Network
You can share a library across a networked environment to allow more than one user to access the library simultaneously.

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click the **Manage Lib. List** button.
- 2. In the Library List dialog box, in the Library list, select the library. You can select multiple libraries using the Shift and Ctrl keys.
- 3. Select the Shared check box.

**Results**

More than one user can access the library file at the same time.

### Controlling Library Search Access
You can enable or disable the searching of a particular library when performing operations that involve libraries, such as adding parts.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click the **Manage Lib. List** button.
- 2. In the Library List dialog box, in the Library list, select the library. You can select multiple libraries using the Shift and Ctrl keys.
- 3. Select the Allow Search check box.

### Protecting Library Files
The Read Only check box is only a status indicator; it is always shaded and unavailable for editing. You can set library read-only status only in the Microsoft Windows File Manager. To ensure file protection, the system administrator who owns the files is the only one who can set or clear the read-only status.

**Procedure**

- 1. In Windows Explorer, locate your library files. By default, libraries installed with the software are located at *C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Libraries.*
- 2. Select all four library files, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Properties dialog box, on the **General** tab, select the Read-only check box.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Results**

The library Read-Only check box in the Library List Dialog Boxwill not update until you reopen the dialog box.

### Synchronizing with SailWind Logic
You can enable or disable the synchronizing of library settings between SailWind Logic and SailWind Layout. When you select the "Synchronize with SailWind Logic" check box in SailWind Layout, all library changes you make within SailWind Layout copy also to SailWind Logic.

**Tip** To ensure a round-trip synchronization, select the same check box in SailWind Logic.

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item, and then click the **Manage Lib. List** button.
- 2. In the Library List Dialog Box, select the Synchronize with SailWind Logic check box.

## Library Attribute Management
Use the Manage Library Attributes dialog box to manage attributes on a library-by-library basis. You can add, delete, and rename attributes for all parts or decals in an individual library or in all libraries. You can also display all the attributes in a library, whether the attributes apply to all items or to individual items.

![](/layout/guide/6/_page_11_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** The Manage Library Attributes dialog box does not manage attributes in the design. Use the Attribute Dictionaryto manage attributes in the design.

[Adding an Attribute to Multiple Library Items](#page-11-1) [Deleting Attributes from Library Items](#page-12-0) [Renaming Attributes of Library Items](#page-12-1)

### Adding an Attribute to Multiple Library Items
You can add an attribute to all parts and decals, or just to parts or decals individually, in one or all libraries.

![](/layout/guide/6/_page_13_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** You can specify the name of an existing attribute. No error message appears when you do this. The only time this may have an adverse effect is if both attributes are assigned to a single item, in which case the error is reported in the error file and the rename is not performed for those items where there are conflicts.

- 7. When you have finished with specifying the New Name, click **Rename Attrs**.
- 8. Click **Close**.

**Results**

Your attribute is renamed. Check for the renamed attribute in the Decal Attributes Dialog Box(for PCB decals) or on the Attributes tab of the Part Information dialog boxon page 1584 (for Part Types).

## Import and Export of Libraries
Use the Library Manager dialog box to import or export library data in ASCII format.

[Importing Library Data](#page-14-2) [Exporting Library Data](#page-14-1)

### Importing Library Data
You can import library data from a previously-exported library ASCII file.

**Tip** Beginning with PADS 9.0, die parts and flip chips are no longer identified by their family designations (DIE or FLP), but instead by the Special Purpose settings in the General tab of the Part Information dialog boxon page 1590. When you import an ASCII file created by a previous PADS version, these Special Purpose settings are automatically set for parts having the logic family DIE or FLP. The part's family designation remains the same.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File > Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager Dialog Box, in the Library list, select the library to receive the library data.
- 3. To import one of the four file types, you must select the matching filter:
	- If the file type is *.c*, select the Logic filter. This ASCII file contains CAE decals (logic symbols).
	- If the file type is *.l*, select the Lines filter. This ASCII file contains drafting objects.
	- If the file type is *.d*, select the Decals filter. This ASCII file contains PCB decals (component footprints).
	- If the file type is *.p*, select the Parts filter. This ASCII file contains part types.
- 4. Click **Import**.

![](/layout/guide/6/_page_14_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Note:** Import fails if the library to receive imported items is read-only.

5. In the Library Import File dialog box, specify the folder and the file name, and then click **Open**.

### Exporting Library Data
You can export library data into an ASCII file for importing into another library.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager Dialog Box, in the Library list, select the library whose data you want to export.
- 3. Click any of the following:
	- **Decals**  Exports PCB decals (component footprints)
	- **Parts**  Exports Components
	- **Lines**  Exports drafting objects
	- **Logic**  Exports CAE decals (schematic symbols)
- 4. An empty filter box yields no results. To filter the list, type [wildcards or expressionson page 155](#page-18-0) in the Filter box. If you do not want to restrict the results with a filter, you can display all items by typing \* (asterisk) in the Filter box.
- 5. Click **Apply**.
- 6. Select one or more items in the list, and then click **Export**.
- 7. In the Library Export File dialog box, specify the folder, type the file name, and then click **Save**.

**Results**

- The Special Purpose settings of any die parts and flip chips are cleared.
- Die parts and flip chips having a family designation other than DIE and FLP lose their die part or flip chip special purpose and become normal parts.
- Any normal parts that have the DIE or FLP family designation are treated as die parts or flip chips in the previous PADS version.

## Library Report Creation
You can create reports from the Library Manager to list any number of library objects. You can configure the Parts report to also list the values of attributes that you choose to include in the report.

[Creating a Report of the Parts in a Library](#page-16-1) [Creating a Report of Decals, Lines or Logic Symbols in a Library](#page-17-0)

### Creating a Report of the Parts in a Library
From the Library Manager, you can generate a report about the parts in a single library or all libraries. The report (an ASCII file) lists each part and its associated attributes. You can specify the attributes you want reported.

Examples of parts reports are shown below.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library manager dialog box, select a library from the Library list, or select (All Libraries).
- 3. In the Filter area, click **Parts**. A list of parts in the library (or in all libraries) appears in the Part Types area.

![](/layout/guide/6/_page_16_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** To refine the list, use the filter field. Type a part name in the field or use wildcards (\*) to specify a group of parts. Then click **Apply**.

- 4. When you have the list of parts you want to report on, click **List to File**.
- 5. In the Report Manager dialog box, specify the part attributes you want to include in the report. In the Available attributes list, click an attribute to select it, then click **Include>>**. The attributes appear in the Selected attributes list.

To remove attributes from the Selected attributes list, select them and click **Exclude>>**.

- 6. Optionally, you can refine the list of parts to include in the report. In the Part Filter field, type a part name in the field or use wildcards (\*) to specify a group of parts. Then click **Apply**.
- 7. Click **Run**.
- 8. In the Library List File dialog box, select a folder and file format for the report. You can select either of two formats:
	- Library List format (lst): Information is formatted in columns for viewing or printing. (See Parts Report in .lst Format below.)
	- Comma-separated values format (csv): format recognized by MS Excel. (See Parts Report in .csv Format below.)

**9. Click Save.**

10. In the Report Manager dialog box, click **Close**.

**Results**

### Creating a Report of Decals, Lines or Logic Symbols in a Library
From the Library Manager, you can generate a report listing the decals, lines, or logic symbols in a single library. The report is an ASCII file listing each item's name along with the date and time the item was modified.

For more information, see "[Creating a Report of the Parts in a Library](#page-16-1)".

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager dialog box, select a library from the Library list. The List to File button is unavailable for Decals, Lines, and Logic Symbols if you select All Libraries.
- 3. In the Filter area, click the filter you want. A list of parts in the library appears in the Part Types area.

**Tip** To select one or more specific item, use the filter field. Type an item name in the field or use wildcards (\*) to specify a group of items. Then click **Apply**.

- 4. When you have the list you want to report on, click **List to File**.
- 5. In the Library List File dialog box, specify a folder and file name for the report and click **Save**.

**Results**

Notepad appears, displaying a list of the item names and the date and time when each was last modified. You can print the list from Notepad.

## Wildcards and Expressions
You can use wildcards and expressions to filter the information that displays.
