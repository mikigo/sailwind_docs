## Placement Strategy
Parts placement depends on multiple factors. In addition to connection length and spacing tolerances, manufacturing considerations such as accessibility for pick-and-place machines and solder treatment

also affect placement. After you determine your manufacturing strategy and import your netlist, use the interactive placement tools to optimize your placement scheme.

Tools to aid in parts placement include:

- Find function that locates and selects parts by reference designator or location
- Separate grid settings for x and y coordinates, set by a modeless command
- Interactive part alignment function
- Nudge interactive parts shoving, with DRC enabled
- Net length minimization
- Connection length minimization
- Automatic and interactive part, pin, and gate swapping
- Automatic part renumbering

Remember to backward annotate engineering change order (ECO) changes to the schematic.

## Placement Guidelines
A number of guidelines will aid you in the development of your component placement design.

A good placement scheme:

- Observes all the restrictions placed on component location and trace routing.
- Provides the easiest routing solutions.

Follow this general order for placement:

1. Place all components that have a fixed location, such as connectors, ICs that require a specific location, and mounting holes.
2. Because of their typically heavy connectivity pattern, connectors need sufficient room between other connectors and the first row of ICs to exit the connector. Allow at least 0.5 mils between the connector and the nearest row of ICs.
3. Place components that have engineering restrictions, such as parts that must be a certain distance from each other, parts that cannot be located next to each other, and parts that must be near the connector.
4. Place components with no overriding placement requirements. Follow these general guidelines:
- A part's pads should fall on the grid used during autorouting. Some standard increments are 100, 50, 25, 20, 16.67, 12.5, or 10 mils. Set up the design grid before placing components.
- The flow of connections should be vertical and horizontal. Minimize diagonal connections.
- Component pads should line up vertically and horizontally so they do not block routing channels. If two ICs are side by side with their pads staggered 50 mils, the pads of one IC block the routing channels of the other.
- For manufacturing reasons, it is better to have all of the ICs on the board oriented in the same direction, rather than some vertical and some horizontal.

## Component Placement Process
SailWind Layout initially overlays all parts at the origin on the top layer. Before placing components, create a board outline, set up the layers of the design, set the grid values, and set up the clearance design rules—specifically those that apply to component placement.

Many commands are available to place your components. You can:

• Switch to SailWind Router and use it to do all of your placements.

**Restriction:** You cannot use unions, clusters, or reuse items in SailWind Router to assist with placement.

• Click the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to disperse all the components around the board outline.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_2_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** Click the **View > Extents** menu item after you disperse components to bring all design objects into view.

- Move components in the design. For more information, see "Moving Components".
- Orient parts radially on a polar grid. For more information, see "Setting Up a Polar Grid".
- Move multiple components sequentially. For more information, see "Sequential Component  Placement".
- Flip components to the bottom layer. For more information, see "Modify the Board-Side Location of Components, Bottom View".
- Array components. For more information, see "Creating a Component Array".
- Align edges or centerlines of multiple components. For more information, see "Aligning Objects".
- Rotate objects in 90 degree increments or at any angle. For more information, see "Rotating an Object, Spinning an Object".
- Swap the locations of two parts. For more information, see "Swapping Parts".
- Automatically nudge overlapping components into positions that agree with the clearance rules. If you disable design rule checking, you can place parts into positions that disagree with your design rule clearances. For more information, see "Nudge Overlapping Parts".

## Setting the Origin of an Object
Set the origin of an object to move it or place it. You can set the origin of a board outline, 2-D line, decal shape (in the PCB Decal Editor), copper shape, keepout shape, and dimension shape.

You can set the origin of an object using the popup menus when creating a Dimensioning Shape or Drafting Shape.

**Procedure**

1. Select the whole shape.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_3_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** Right-click and click the **Select Shape**, **Select Documentation**, or **Select Board Outline**  popup menu selection shortcuts to select the whole shape. As an alternative, you can press the Shift key and select a segment - this selects the shape rather than a segment or corner.

2. Right-click and click the **Set Origin** popup menu item.
3. Click to set the new origin point. A message appears to confirm the origin point.
4. Click **Yes** to change the origin point or click **No** to use the previous origin point.
5. To exit Set Origin mode, press the Esc key.

## Placement and Length Minimization
Before you begin placement, set the topology types you want to use for nets, net classes, or the Default level of the rules hierarchy. *Topology* is the pattern of the trace and the order in which to connect pins in a net. The Length Minimization tool reorders pin connections in a net to support the topology you set.

Length minimization does not change the netlist, it just finds better places to make connections required by the netlist. For example, if you specify the "minimized" topology for a net, length minimization finds the pin order that produces the shortest pin-to-pin connections.

When you move a part around the layout, length minimization happens on the fly. If the topology type is set to something other than "protected," you can see ratsnest connections linking and unlinking pins on the moved part to the nearest viable terminals on other parts. Also, as you move the part, a running measurement called New Length/Old Length appears on the message line. 100 equals 100 percent of all nets connected to the part when you picked it up. If the percentage becomes less than 100, the length is getting better. If the percentage becomes more than 100, the length is getting worse. When you have

a placement you think will work, you can also run length minimization for the entire board by using the Length Minimization command.

Generally, placement that minimizes connection length should be your primary consideration. However, using minimum connection length to determine part location can result in dense areas of connections, usually in the center of the board. These connections can outnumber the routing channels available in the area. Consequently, after you minimize the connection length, study the board to see whether there are critical dense areas. Do not hesitate to make local adjustments to the component locations to spread the connections away from the dense areas.

Part swapping also depends on topology type. No ECO file is required or generated for length minimization or part swapping. On the other hand, gate swapping, pin swapping, and ECL terminator swapping, are all recorded in an ECO file for backward annotation. There may be, however, some highspeed or critical nets in your design for which you want to set to the "protected" topology type before you begin placement.

## Controlling Length Minimization
You can control length minimization by using different methods, each having a distinct effect on the your design environment.

There are two levels of control for length minimization.

- The Length minimize setting in the Design category of the Options dialog box that determines if and when length minimization occurs when moving a component - during a move, or after a move which consumes less display memory.
- The more detailed controls are configured at the Default or a hierarchical rules level, in the Routing Rules dialog box. For more information, see the Routing Rules Dialog Box on page 1666topic.

## Minimizing Unrouted Connection Length
Before you begin placement, consider setting the topology types you want to use. Running a length minimization does not change the netlist; it just finds better places to make the same connections the netlist specifies, based on the topology types you set.

**Procedure**

Click the **Tools > Length Minimization** menu item.

The nets are reordered to minimize the length between connection points.

## Placement Related ECOs
An engineering change order (ECO) is a change in design that either comes to the board from the schematic or occurs in the layout and effects the schematic.

Because ordinary length minimization and part swapping do not change the netlist, you do not need to backward annotate them to the schematic. You must, however, record in an *.eco* file length minimization and placement optimization tools like gate and pin swapping and reference designator renumbering. For this reason, these commands are located on the ECO Toolbar. When you access the ECO Toolbar you are automatically prompted to make this file.

## Use of the Find Dialog Box During Placement
If you imported parts using the *.asc* format, the placement process usually begins with design parts overlaying at the design origin.

You can use the Find Dialog Boxto break out and select certain parts, or groups of a package type. The dialog box can also attach parts to your pointer for individual placement.

## Component Spacing
SailWind Layout provides automated rules checking to ensure adequate spacing between components.

**Spacing Basics**

The software places components using the units of the Design grid when you enable the snap to grid setting of the Design grid.

The software prevents components from overlapping if you have set up a Body to body Clearanceon page 1167 rule and the Online DRCon page 1503 (design rule checking) is in Prevent errors mode.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_5_Figure_10.jpeg)

The preceding illustration shows examples of how some of the design clearance rules are interpreted by DRC in various design situations.

During placement operations (with Online DRC enabled), the system examines the design rules for the component being placed and compares them against other design objects including other components, the board outline and board cutouts.

All of the design rules are equally and separately enforced. If values are specified for each of the design clearance rules, then they are individually checked. During placement operations (with Online DRC enabled), the system does not allow a part to be placed if any design clearance rule is in violation of its specified value.

Typically, when a component is moved into the proximity of another component, the system will check the following design rules (if values are assigned):

- Body/Layer 20 (placement) outline against other body/Layer 20 (placement) outlines
- Body/Layer 20 (placement) outline against board outline or board cutout(s)
- Pad/SMD to Pad/Via/SMD/Trace/Copper/Text/Board/Drill clearances (with full rules hierarchy support)
- Pad and SMD Same Net clearances (with full rules hierarchy support)

The component body is considered to be the furthest extent of any 2D line object on the following layers:

- Component layer (top or bottom)
- Associated silkscreen layer for component layer (silkscreen top or bottom)
- All Layers/Layer 0 (zero).

There is only one "Body to body" clearance value that must apply to all components.

**Body-to-Body Checking Rules**

The "Body to body" check has specific rules associated with it during placement operations with DRC enabled:

- If the body outline encounters another body outline, and no other clearance violations exist, then the "Body to body" rule is applied.
- SailWind Layout does not have a "Body to Pad/SMD" design rule, therefore, in a situation where a component body/Layer 20 (placement) outline is in proximity to the TH or SMD pads of another component, the "Body to body" clearance value is used during checking as the minimum target clearance value between the TH/SMD pads and the component body/Layer 20 (placement) outline.
- If the TH or SMD pads of a component are in proximity to the TH or SMD pads of another component, and the component body/Layer 20 (placement) outlines of the components do not violate the "Body to body" clearance value, then the system enforces the corresponding Pad/SMD to Pad/Via/SMD/Trace/Copper/Text/Board/Drill clearances (with full rules hierarchy support).

DRC checks the "Body to body" spacing between:

- Component body outline to component body outline
- Layer 20 outline to Layer 20 outline
- Component body outline to Layer 20 outline

The software references the "Body to body" measurement from the edges of the 2D lines that define the body of the components.

**Advanced Spacing**

While a single "Body to body" clearance may suit many of your components, you may have many parts that require extra spacing, for the pick and place process, or for rework.

You can create a custom clearance outline in the decal on Layer 20. The software uses this larger placement outline, called a "component courtyard" or "nudge outline", during the placement process to create more spacing around components. The software considers the Layer 20 (placement) outline as part of the component body. Whenever it is encountered, the "Body to body" clearance rule is invoked.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_7_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** In extended layers modeon page 315, Layer 20 becomes Layer 120.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_7_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Collision Prevention**

If you set the Nudge option to "automatic" or "prompt", when you attempt to overlap parts, the component either nudges automatically or you are prompted for the direction to move the component away from the one you are placing.

If you disable Nudge and turn off the Online DRC during placement, as a post-process, you can nudge all offending components with the **Tools** menu > **Nudge Components** command, but you have no control over the offending components and where they move.

You can create arrays of parts that automatically space rows and columns of components by values that you supply using the Create Array Dialog Box.

**Spacing Verification**

If you are unsure if components have been placed outside of the design rules that you have set up, you can run a clearance check (click the **Verify Design > Clearance** menu item). Be sure that all aspects of your components, including the outline color for Layer 20 are visible since the clearance check only verifies objects that are visible and within view during its checking routine.

In the Clearance Checking Setupon page 1164, select the check box for the following:

- Body to body to check for the "Body to body" clearance value between component bodies.
- Placement Outline to check for the "Body to body" clearance value between the Layer 20 outlines

**Note:**

If you select both the Body to body and the Placement outline checks, the system also checks for clearance violations between the component body outlines and the Placement (Layer 20) outlines.

## Moving Components
You can move components as required to optimize part placement.

**Procedure**

1. Attach the component(s) to your pointer using one of the following methods:
	- On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Design Toolbar** button to display the Design Toolbar. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Move**, and then select a component. You can only move one component at a time.
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move and drag the component(s) to the desired location. The Drag moves optionon page 1531 must be set to Drag and attach or Drag and drop. For more information, see "Drag Moves area of the Global > General optionson page 1531".
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move, right-click and click **Move**.
	- With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components** popup menu item, then select one or more components to move and on the Design Toolbar, click the **Move** button.

If you move a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

When you move a group, an error may appear in a Trace Copy Dialog Box.

If you try to move a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the move.

2. The component attaches to your pointer according to the Move preference optionon page 1503.

**Tip**

While the component is attached to the cursor, you can right-click and click commands like **Rotate 90**, **Spin**, **Flip Side**, change the Move preference, activate Snapping to objectson page 1540, or set the On-line DRCon page 1503 to ignore clearance rules. Use Bottom View for a more realistic view when placing components on the bottom side of the board.

3. To place the component, use one of the following methods:
	- Move the pointer to the new location and click to place the component.
	- Use one of the S Modeless Commandsto proceed to a specific coordinate. Press the Spacebar key to place the component. This substitutes a mouse click that could move the pointer off the coordinate that you specified.

## Moving Items With Move by Origin
When you select several objects at once, you can use different origins for the move.

If you select Move by Origin in the Design category of the Options dialog box, the pointer snaps to the center of the group, calculated from the extents of the group, and uses it as the origin for the move.

## Moving Items With Stretch Traces During Component Move
When you select a component with partial traces connected to the pins of the component, the traces stretch to remain connected to the pins as long as you have "Stretch traces during component move" selected in the Design category of the Options.

Each trace connected to a pin of the moving component connects to the new pin position. If DRC is off, straight-line segments are added. If DRC is on, traces are rerouted with smoothed patterns using AutoRoute. When "Stretch traces during component move" is not selected, unroutes are created between the tacks of the trace connections.

## Moving Design Objects Radially
Use Radial Move to adjust the orientation of objects. This command supports creation of circular decals and circular boards. You can also use Radial Move with text and reference designators.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You must set up a Polar Gridon page 352.
- In the PCB Decal Editor, you can only use Radial Move with terminals.

**Procedure**

1. Select single or multiple components or unions. In the PCB Decal Editor, select single or multiple terminals.
2. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Design Toolbar** button to display the Design Toolbar.
3. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Radial Move** button. The status bar displays the current polar radius and polar angle position in addition to the angular and radial increments.

**Tip** You can alternately move design objects radially using verb mode. First, on the Design Toolbar, click the **Radial Move** button and then select the desired design object(s) to move. This method will keep the Radial Move command active and allow you to repeat the operation again after you have finished moving you first selection(s).

4. If you did not previously set up the polar grid to match your design requirements, click the **Tools > Options** menu item, select the **Grids** category, then click **Radial Move Setup**. The Radial Move Setup dialog box appears. For more information, see "Radial Move Setup Dialog Box".

Set up the polar grid and move options and click **OK**. SailWind Layout saves these settings to apply to any future use of Radial Move in the current session.

The polar grid appears and the selected objects attach to the pointer.

5. Move the selected objects to an eligible site.
6. Click to indicate a location on the polar grid for the selected objects.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_10_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** When you exit Radial Move, the polar grid is turned off. Use the GP modeless command on page 83 to turn the polar grid on and off independently of Radial Move.

**Examples**

Placing or moving parts on a radial grid utilizes a slightly different approach than that of the standard x/y grid. Examples will illustrate the behavior of the placement and move commands when using the polar grid.

The following graphic shows an example polar grid definition.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 31. An Example Polar Grid Definition**

The following table shows the Radial Move settings used to create the polar grid in the figure above.

## Sequential Component Placement
After selecting a predetermined set of components, you can use the "Move Sequential" command to sequentially place components on your pointer for placement in the design.

Placing Components Sequentially Using the Find Dialog Box Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace

### Placing Components Sequentially Using the Find Dialog Box
Use the Find dialog box to choose components by selecting them from a list. This method places the components on your cursor in alphanumeric order.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Edit> Find** menu item.
2. In the Find Dialog Box, set Find by to Ref. Designator, Part Type, Decals, Unions or Clusters.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** Select multiple Ref. Des. prefixes, part types or decals in order to expand the list of available components.

3. From the resulting list, select all the parts you want to move. Drag or use Shift-click for a range of components, and/or Ctrl+click for multiple components.
4. In the Action list, choose Move Sequential.

The Move by ascending Ref Des order has no function when used with the Find dialog box. Components are always added to the pointer in ascending Ref Des order. This feature is only used by the Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace method.

5. Click **OK**.

6. In the dialog box, "Proceed with next object? <value>" click:

- **Yes** to attach parts to the cursor successively, but prompt after every placement to allow you to skip over components if desired
- **Yes to All** if the alphanumeric order of the selection is okay and you do not intend to skip over components.
- **No**  to skip this part, and go to the next.

The first part is attached to the pointer for placement. Parts are attached to the pointer in ascending Ref Des order.

With a part attached to the pointer, you can right-click to access the Rotate 90, Spin mode, Flip, move preferences, and Snap to features and commands. You can also use modeless commands. If a part selected for Move Sequential has a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning dialog box appears informing you of changes you are making to the test point. Test points are locked in the Routing optionson page 1542.

7. Click to place each component, union, or cluster.

### Placing Components Sequentially in the Workspace
You select components by either using the Project Explorer or by right-clicking directly in the working area to apply the Move Sequential command. This method places the components on your cursor in the reverse order of your selection order - last component selected is attached to the cursor first.

**Procedure**

1. Use one or both of the following methods to select the components:
	- In the Project Explorer with Allow Selectionon page 53 enabled, use Ctrl+click to select multiple components.
	- In the working area, with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Components**, **Select Unions/Components**, or **Select Clusters** popup menu item. Using Ctrl+click, select multiple components, unions or clusters.

The parts are attached to the pointer in the order in which they are selected. The first component selected is the first one attached to the pointer. You can override this in a later step.

2. In the working area, right-click and click the **Move Sequential** popup menu item.

**Note:** The Move by ascending Ref Des order can override the order in which you selected the components and place the components on your pointer in ascending Ref Des order.

3. In the dialog box, "Proceed with next object? <value>" click:
	- **Yes** to attach parts to the cursor successively, but prompt after every placement to allow you to skip over components if desired
	- **Yes to All** if the alphanumeric order of the selection is okay and you do not intend to skip over components.
	- **No**  to skip this part, and go to the next.

The first part is attached to the pointer for placement. With a part attached to the pointer, you can right-click to access the Rotate 90, Spin mode, Flip, move preferences, and Snap to features and commands. You can also use modeless commands.

You can set the Move preference to select a part by its Origin or Midpoint in the Design optionson page 1503.

Placement uses the current design grid. To place components with a Radial Move, turn on the polar grid on using the GP modeless commandon page 83.

If a part selected for Move Sequential has a pin that is a locked test point, a Warning dialog box appears informing you of changes you are making to the test point. Test points are locked in the Routing optionson page 1542. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

4. Click to place the component.

## Modify the Board-Side Location of Components
Use Flip Side to move a part or parts to the opposite side of the board. The flipped part moves to the opposite side in a hinging motion, pivoting on a vertical axis through the part origin.

Text is mirrored so it always appears in the proper orientation. Use Flip Groupon page 488 to flip a component or components around an origin point you specify.

When you flip a component to the opposite side, layer associations change with the component. To turn off moving layer associations with components, set the /NTL switchon page 488 before using Flip Side or Flip Group.

**CAUTION:**

Use associated copper rather than free copper in decals in the solder or paste mask. Results are unexpected when TrueLayer is on and you use free copper.

Flipping a Component Flipping a Group Use of the /NTL Switch

### Flipping a Component
You can move a component to the opposite side of the board using its origin as the mirror point.

**Procedure**

1. Select one or more components to move to the opposite side.
2. Use one of the following:
	- Right-click and click the **Flip Side** popup menu item.
	- Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Component Properties Dialog Box, select the opposite layer in the Layer list.

**Results**

If DRC is on and the system encounters a clearance violation, the flip is canceled. Test points flip with the flipped component.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_16_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip** Use Bottom View for a more realistic view when placing components on the bottom side of the board.

### Flipping a Group
You can move a group of components to the opposite side of the board by specifying the mirrored location.

**Procedure**

1. Select the components, right-click, then click the **Flip Group** popup menu item.
2. Click to indicate the mirror location.

### Use of the /NTL Switch
Layer associations automatically switch with a component when you flip it to another side.

Typically you would want to layer associations to move with the component. For example, you move a surface mounted component to the bottom of the board. The assembly drawing, silkscreen, solder mask and paste mask layer information moves from the top side to the bottom side documentation layers.

If for some special reason, you do not want this to occur, set the /NTL switch before starting SailWind Layout to turn TrueLayer associations off. For more information, see "Software Launch Options".

## Component Arrays
You can arrange parts by creating *arrays*. A component array is a union with members placed on sites of a user-defined matrix.

Component Array Examples Creating a Component Array Modifying a Component Array

### Component Array Examples
You can create either planar arrays or circular arrays.

**Polar Grid or Circular Array**

A number of specific values are utilized in the configuration of a polar grid or circular array.

The figure below shows the different values that you set to create a polar grid or a circular array. In a circular array, components are placed equal distances from each other on one or several rings. By turning on the polar grid and Snap to Grid, you can create drafting items with corners located at the nodes of the polar grid.

**Planar Array**

A planar array is a union of components that are placed on the intersections of equidistant parallel lines.

The figure below shows the different values that you set to create a planar array. The parallel lines can exist in both the X and Y directions.

**Figure 33. Planar Array**

**Table 100. Circular Array Settings(continued)**

### Creating a Component Array
You can arrange parts by creating either circular or planar arrays.

**Procedure**

1. Select the components you want, right-click, then click the **Create Array** popup menu item.
2. Click the tab that represents the array you want to create: Planar Array or Circular Array.
3. Set the options for the array and click **OK**. A dialog box appears asking you for an array or union name. For more information, see "Component Arrays".
4. Type a name for the array or accept the default name and click **OK**. By default, arrays are sequentially named with an ARR\_ prefix; for example, the first array in your design is named ARR\_1, the second array is named ARR\_2, and so on.

The array is created and attaches to your pointer.

You can use Move shortcut menu commands, such as Flip, Spin, and Rotate, while placing the array.

If you move a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

If you try to move a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the move.

5. Click to indicate a location for the array.

### Modifying a Component Array
Using Modify Array, you can rearrange the components in an array after placing it, or you can modify a union.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When modifying a component array:

- You must select Unions in the Selection Filter to select arrays and unions.
- You can only modify one array or union at a time.

**Procedure**

1. Select an array or union, right-click, then click the **Modify Array** popup menu item.
	- If you are modifying an array, the Modify Array dialog box appears with the tab displayed and the options used to create the array.
	- If you are creating an array from a union, a dialog box appears asking whether to dissolve the union to create an array. Click **Yes** to create the array from the Union. The Create Array dialog box appears.
2. Modify array options as necessary.

Modify Array does not enter Move mode as Create Array does.

Modify Array does not warn against nor prevent placement violations unless On-line DRC is in Prevent errors or Warn errors mode.

If you modify the location of an array that contains a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

3. Click **OK**. The array is modified or created from the union.
4. If On-line DRC is in Prevent errors or Warn errors mode, click to indicate a new position for the modified array.

## Aligning Objects
Alignment snaps selected parts to an imaginary line coming from a side or center of a guide component. After placing objects roughly in position, you can select several objects and automatically align them. The alignment command aligns all selected objects with the last one selected.

You can use Align with: pins (and align components by those pins), reference designators, unions in the Layout Editor, and terminals and terminal numbers in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

1. Using Ctrl+click, select the objects you want to include in the alignment ensuring that you select the master object last.
2. Right-click and click the **Align** popup menu item.

**Restriction:**

You cannot align elements in a physical design reuse. Align becomes unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

3. In the Align dialog boxon page 1080, click the alignment scheme you want to use. The objects are automatically aligned according to the position of the last one selected.

Automatic alignment does not guarantee minimum spacing if on-line DRC is not enabled, but you can use Nudge to accomplish this interactively. If On-line DRC is set to Prevent or Warn, Align does not perform the alignment if it causes a violation. Violations are reported in the status bar.

## Rotating an Object
You can rotate objects in 90 degree increments.

**Procedure**

1. Select the object to rotate. You can select more than one object at a time.
2. Right-click and click the **Rotate 90** popup menu item. The selected object rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.

If you rotate a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting."

When you rotate a group, an error may appear in one of the Trace Copy dialog boxes. For more information, see "Trace Copy Dialog Box."

If you try to rotate a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_25_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** To use Rotate 90 in Verb Mode, click the **Rotate** button on the Design Toolbar and then select the part to rotate.

3. Repeat step 2 to continue rotating the objects.

## Spinning an Object
You can spin an object on its axis during part placement.

**Procedure**

1. Select the object to spin.
2. Right-click and click **Spin**. The part attaches to the pointer. As you move the pointer, the part follows, changing the rotation angle.

You can multiple-select and rotate a group of parts in the same way; each turns on its own axis.

To view the angle of rotation as you spin the part, right-click and click **Properties**. The current angle appears in the Rotation box.

If you spin a component with a pin that is a locked test point, a warning appears. For more information, see "Troubleshooting".

If you try to spin a component that is part of a physical design reuse, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.

3. Click to indicate a new angle.
4. To use Spin in Verb Mode, click the **Spin** button on the Design Toolbar, and then select the part to spin. click to indicate a new angle.

## Swapping Parts
Sometimes simply switching neighboring parts' positions can improve connection length. You can swap the position of two parts anywhere on the board using the "Swap Part" command. When Online DRC is selected, the swap is examined for placement violations.

**Procedure**

1. To begin, use one of the following methods:
	- **For a single swap**  Select a part > Design Toolbar button > **Swap Part** button.
	- **For multiple swaps Design Toolbar** button > **Swap Part** button > select the first part to switch.
2. Select the second part to switch.
3. You are prompted to allow the swap and at the same time, the X + Y connection lengths before and after the swap appear in the status bar so you can see whether the lengths improve.
4. Click **Yes** to complete the swap. Parts are swapped origin-to-origin.

If you chose the multiple swap method and you are still in Swap Part mode, you can continue to choose parts to swap.

## Interactive Placement Tools
You can place parts to exact tolerances using the alignment and nudge tools.

When placing parts interactively, note the following effects of alignment and nudge:

- Alignment snaps selected parts along an imaginary line coming from a side or center of a guide component.
- Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_27_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** For nudging, all component elements are considered glued. Align and Nudge are unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

Nudging Parts

### Nudging Parts
When parts are close enough to violate either pad-to-pad or body-to-body clearance rules, they are considered overlapping.

Nudge and Design Rule Checking \(DRC\) Nudge Overlapping Parts Nudging All Components Nudging Single Parts

#### Nudge and Design Rule Checking (DRC)
When DRC is set to Prevent, SailWind Layout actively prevents overlapping by canceling the completion of an illegal move and returning the selected component to Move mode.

This automatic checking can be further refined using Nudge. Nudge is a shove function for parts; it resolves overlapping by moving surrounding parts away from the part you are trying to place. Nudge has three operational modes that you set on the **Design** category of the Options dialog box. As shown in the table below, Nudge operation is dependent on the current DRC setting:

| DRC Setting                                                         | Prevent                                                                                                                                  | Warn                                                                         | Off or Ign Clrn                                            |

**Table 101. DRC Setting and Nudge Modes**

When you use Nudge for placement, SailWind Layout approximates the component size. For example, if you placed an L-shaped component, SailWind Layout approximates that part area as a square, not as an L. Nudge then uses the greater of the pad-to-pad or body-to-body clearances defined in Design Rules setup to determine the distance that must exist between two components.

In many cases, several parts are adjusted to accommodate the moved part. Nudge does not move glued parts or parts outside the board outline. Nudge treats test points as glued objects. Nudge does not move parts inside the board outline outside the outline. When an overlap exists, the Nudge Parts and Unions dialog box appears.

Nudge does adhere to the current grid setting, so be sure you set the grid fine enough for the command place within the restrictions of your routing strategy.

#### Nudge Overlapping Parts
Use Nudge to move overlapping parts. The manner in which Nudge operates is dependent on the current DRC setting.

<span id="page-29-2"></span>For more information, see Nudging Parts.

#### Nudging All Components
You can move all overlapping parts at once using the Nudge Components command. Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component.

**Procedure**

Click the **Tools > Nudge Components** menu command.

<span id="page-29-3"></span>All components are automatically nudged according to the design rules.

#### Nudging Single Parts
Nudge eliminates overlaps and clearance violations by pushing parts aside to make room for a crowded component. You can use Nudge to move an individual part that overlaps another part.

**Procedure**

1. Select a part.
2. Right-click and click the **Nudge** popup menu item. For more information, see

Nudge does not move glued parts or parts outside the board outline. Parts inside the board outline are not nudged outside the outline.

Nudge considers test points to be glued objects.

You cannot nudge elements in a physical design reuse. All component elements are considered glued. Nudge is unavailable when you select physical design reuse elements.

3. In the Nudge Parts and Unions Dialog Boxon page 1495, click the nudge direction and the direction to move overlapping parts.
4. Click **Run** to perform the nudge.
5. Often, several parts are adjusted to accommodate the moved part. Nudge identifies these parts, and allows for further adjustments, by displaying them in a specific color:
	- **Select color**  All parts affected by the Nudge routine.
	- **Highlight color**  The part to move in the next pass of Nudge.

## Changing the Part Outline Width
You use this procedure to change the width of the 2D lines that indicate the part outline on Silkscreen Top/ Bottom layers.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• This procedure does not apply to placement (nudge) outlines created on Layer 20.

**Procedure**

1. Select a component, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
2. Type a width (between 0 and 250) in the Part Outline Width box.
3. Click **OK**.

This change is reflected in the design only; the library is not updated.

Alternate decals in use are modified; alternate decals not in use are not modified.

Online DRC "Body to body" checking and Verify the Design look at the part outline when checking.

| CAUTION: |  |  |
|----------|--|--|
|          |  |  |

In SailWind Layout, the "Body to body" clearance checks are performed between the edges of the lines used to define the component body outlines. Increasing the widths of these lines may impact the spacing between existing components in the design and require you to perform a Verify Design Clearance check to assure that all of the "Body to body" clearances are maintained.

4. To update all parts that have the same decals as the selected parts with the new part outline width, click **Continue**.

## Modifying Component Properties
You can edit or change component properties to reflect changes in the design.

**Procedure**

1. Select a component.
2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. The Component Properties Dialog Box appears.

**Restriction:**

Several of the options on the dialog box are unavailable when the component is part of a physical design reuse.

3. Make any necessary changes and click **OK**.

## Creating a Label
You can create labels using the **Labels** tab in the Component Properties dialog box.

## Cluster and Union Placement
Use cluster placement features to create associations or groupings of connected parts.

Two object types are used:

- **Unions**  are user-created part associations that have a strict relationship with each other. An example of this is associating a filter capacitor to reside on top of an IC. When you move or place a selected union, the physical relationship between the parts, or union members, remains unchanged. Unions are not created using the Cluster Placement routines, but they are considered during cluster creation and automatic placement operations. For information, see the Unionstopic.
- **Clusters**  are collections of individual parts, unions, and other clusters, based on connectivity. A series of ICs and associated discrete components that make up a memory array could make up a cluster. Clusters differ from unions because the parts that belong to the cluster, or cluster members, are rearranged within the cluster to improve placement.

Clusters are useful in very large designs or in designs where areas of the board are separated into different functions. You can create or modify clusters manually or automatically. You can also automatically place individual parts using this feature. For more information, see the Placing Parts  Automaticallyand Moving Clusters Interactivelytopics.

Any operation that creates, displays, or modifies clusters (except the Cluster Manager) automatically places you in Cluster View mode. For more information, see the Cluster View Mode topic.

**Cluster Display Settings**

The circle that represents a cluster is assigned in the Display Colors Setup dialog box as a 2D Lines property on the Top layer. The text representing the cluster name is assigned as a Text property on layer 20.

The connection lines originating from the center of the cluster (the same as in the normal view) are assigned with the Connection setting in the Display Colors Setup dialog box.

## Unions
*Unions* are user-created part associations that have a strict relationship with each other, such as distance, rotation angle, top, or bottom side.

A common example is placing a filter capacitor to reside on top of an IC. When a selected union is moved or placed, the physical relationship between the parts, or union members, remains unchanged.

### Automatic Placement
Use the Cluster Placement dialog box to build new clusters, place clusters within the board outline, and place parts within the board outline.

Preparing for Automatic Placement Placing Parts Automatically

#### Preparing for Automatic Placement
After you create a board outline and import a netlist, SailWind Layout locates all parts at the board origin. You can then prepare your design for automatic placement and begin the automatic placement process.

**Procedure**

1. Set the Design Grid to accommodate the parts you want to place. In English units a common grid is 100 or 50 mils for ICs and 50 mils for discrete parts. Start with a grid that is the most common denominator for your ICs.
2. Place all parts that should be in a fixed location, such as connectors, mounting holes, and so on. Select these parts.
3. Click the **Properties** button.
4. Select the Glued check box in the Properties dialog box to prevent Automatic Placement from moving the parts.
5. Click the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to move all unglued components outside and around the board outline. Disperse arranges parts around the board outline based on height and length.

![](/layout/guide/21/_page_42_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** Disperse ignores components that are part of a physical design reuse.

6. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Component Keepout** button to create areas where parts should not be placed during automatic placement.
7. Use the **Rotate** and **Flip** buttons to arrange parts that should be placed at an angle or reside on the bottom side of the design.

#### Placing Parts Automatically
As a time-saving option, you can choose to place parts on your PCB design automatically.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Tools > Cluster Placement** menu item.
2. Click the **Place Parts** button. To modify the automatic placement options, click the **Setup** button (below the Place Parts button). For more information see Place Parts Setup Dialog Box.
3. Click **Run**. A status dialog box appears to show placement progress. For more information see "Automatic Placement".

### Cluster Management
Use Cluster Manager to display and manage cluster members and unions. You can move cluster members and unions from one cluster to another and break, or delete, clusters.

Cluster Manager works similarly to the Microsoft Windows Explorer; with it you can view items at the top level or at any level of the hierarchy.

The main elements of the Cluster Manager dialog box are two list boxes showing all clusters, unions, and components that exist in the design.

2. In one list box, view the hierarchy of the cluster you want to add to.
3. In the other list box, select the components you want to add to the cluster.
4. Click the Move **Arrow** button.

#### Making Members of One Cluster Part of Another
If desired, you can merge members of one cluster into another.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Tools > Cluster Manager** menu item.
2. View the hierarchy of the cluster to add to in either list.
3. In the other list, view the hierarchy of the cluster containing the members to merge.
4. Highlight the members you want to move.
5. Click the Move **Arrow** button.

**Results**

Removing all members from a cluster empties the cluster, but does not delete the cluster name until you click **OK** to end the session. Before clicking **OK**, you can add members to this empty cluster by doubleclicking it and repeating the above steps for the members to add.
