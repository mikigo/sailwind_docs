## Design Rules
Design rules represent constraints, such as clearances and available routing layers, that support manufacturing, signal integrity, and other design requirements. SailWind Layout can perform design rule checking as you interactively place and route the design (called on-line design rule checking or just DRC), or after you complete design operations.

Most rules that you set up are used by On-line Design Rule Checking and can actively prevent you from making design errors. Some rules are only checked as a post-process using the Verify Design utility. Lastly, some rules are only used by the advanced capabilities of SailWind Router.

### Setup Strategy
The first step in your strategy for setting up the rules of your design is to create a set of default rules.

The default rules are a set of rules that apply to all the objects in your design that will not have any other rules assigned. Objects with hierarchical rules take precedence over the default rules. For example, a pin pair rule with a Trace Width of 10 will override the default rule with a Trace Width of 5.

**Note:** Larger clearance rules always have precedence despite the order of the hierarchy. For example, if you use a Default clearance rule of 50 mils, but a higher Net clearance rule of 10 mils, the more restrictive default clearance rule of 50 mils has precedence and is applied to the net even though a hierarchical Net clearance was created. Clearance rules should be less restrictive at lower levels of the hierarchy. They should be a minimum clearance value.

After the Default rule set has been created, create hierarchical rules based on the requirements of your design. Any hierarchical rules that are created are based on the Default set.

### Design Rule Hierarchy
The design rule hierarchy enables you to specify a default set of rules for the entire design and additional rules for individual objects or collections of objects.

For example, you might specify in the default design rules a small trace width that would be adequate for signal nets, and then specify a large trace width for a classon page 1816 composed of power nets.

Because objects can be subject to multiple design rules, the design rule hierarchy specifies the priority of the rule types, so you can predict which design rule is applied to an object.

**Basic Object Hierarchy**

The objects in the design are defined using a basic object or relational hierarchy.

The design hierarchy can be easily visualized in the Rules Dialog Box.

The lowest level of the hierarchy begins with the Default level. Once you set the Default rules, they apply to all design objects, unless you customize the rules at a higher level of the hierarchy. In the figure below, each object to the right of the Default rules takes precedence over the object before it. For example, the Net level has a higher priority than the Class level, which has only a higher priority than the Default level. The Component level of the hierarchy has the highest priority in the hierarchy.

**Complete Hierarchy**

The complete hierarchy is not limited to the seven buttons in the Rules dialog box.

Conditional Rules add many levels in between and are used extensively in the complete design rule hierarchy. Conditional design rules are rules that come into effect when an object is adjacent to another object named in the conditional rule and/or on a layer named in the conditional rule. For example: Change a trace at any point in its length depending on the layer on which it resides. Net A may be assigned a default clearance of 12, but may need to reduce to 8 when it enters layer 4. In this case, you can assign 12 as the default for net A and make a conditional rule which applies an 8 mil clearance to net A against layer 4.

Although the hierarchy is more extensive than the basic object hierarchy as seen in the Rules dialog box, the relationships that are found in the basic object hierarchy are still maintained by the conditional rules. For example, Net rules have a priority over Class rules in the basic hierarchy. So, a net to net conditional rule also has priority over a class to class rule.

The following list is the complete hierarchy when all possible design rules are involved. This lists the priority for all rules from lowest to highest. Default rules, at level 1, have the lowest priority and represent the lowest level of the rules hierarchy. Component rules, at level 32, have the highest priority and represent the highest level of the rules hierarchy.

### Non-Default Rules Indicators
When you change rules in the hierarchy from the default rules, two types of indicators appear.

The indicators visually show that rules have been customized from the default rules.

• The categories of rules customized at the current rule level are displayed parenthetically beside the class, net, group, or pin pair name in the list.

**Figure 29. Non-Default Parenthetical Indicators**

C = Clearance rules

R = Routing rules

H = High speed rules

Example: A net listing followed by (RH) has non-default routing and high speed rules definitions.

• The icon that appears below each rule category button indicates whether the rules are customized at the current rule level or if it is only customized at another rule level.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_6_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 30. Non-Default Icon Indicators**

The meaning of the icon corresponds to the button in the Hierarchy area of the Rules dialog box.

Example: If a green polygon appears below the Clearance button, then the default values apply at the current level of the hierarchy for the object you've selected.

### Advanced Rules Option
The Advanced Rules option is a license-enabled modular add-on that extends the restricted rule set to allow use of the full rule set.

The full set of constraints allow for control of more complex designs. Without the Advanced Rules option, you only have access to the Default, and Net design rules. With the Advanced Rules options, your license enables the Class, Group, Pin Pairs, Decal, Component, Conditional Rules, and Differential Pairs Rules.

When you use Advanced Rules, the Hierarchical dialog boxes on the Design Rules dialog box are available. You can read in hierarchically assigned rules from a netlist and edit and save rule changes using the hierarchy.

If you do not have the Advanced Rules option, the Hierarchical dialog boxes on the Design Rules dialog box are not available. However, schematic-applied hierarchical rules reside in the netlist, and they can be passed to any autorouter that can interpret them.

### Design Rule Checking
On-line Design Rule Checking (DRC) provides continuous rule checking during routing and placement.

On-line DRC does not check clearance for text, open associated copper, or free copper belonging to a decal. The following table shows the four DRC modes.

| Mode           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |

**Table 95. Design Rule Checking Modes**

To turn On-line DRC on use the **Design** category in the Options dialog box or the modeless command, DRP or DRW. After activating On-line DRC, you can change the setting using the dialog box, or the modeless commands.

When On-line DRC is activated, an octagon shaped guard band appears at the end of the route to indicate any clearance violation. You can hide the guard band using the Show Guard Band option in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.

On-line Design Rule Checking is available on most SailWind Layout configurations. For Advanced Design Rules package users, all hierarchical rules, except High Speed EDC settings, are monitored.

**Clearance Checking Against Text**

For clearance checking against text, a rectangle referred to as an extent box is drawn around the text string, calculated as a smallest rectangle that will contain the text string. If a text string is rotated, the extent box is also rotated.

Text strings included in clearance checking are those that exist on the same level as other checked objects, or created to appear and on all layers.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Text belonging to a decal is not checked for clearance by On-line DRC.

**Clearance Checking Against Copper**

Clearance checking against copper includes closed or open copper that is not part of the current net being routed and exists on the same layer as other checked objects. Closed copper in a decal that is associated with a terminal is checked for clearance by On-line DRC.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_8_Picture_10.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

On-line DRC does not check the clearance of open associated copper and free copper belonging to a decal.

## Design Rules Transfer
Schematic and design files store the design rules you create. Design rules set up in SailWind Logic transfer automatically when you import the netlist into SailWind Layout. Design rules you set up in SailWind Layout become available automatically when you open the design in SailWind Router.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_8_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:**

SailWind Logic supports only default, class, and net rules.

## Import and Export of Design Rules
You can export and import design rules for the purpose of reusing them in future designs that require the same constraints.

- To export design rules, follow the instructions to export an ASCII fileon page 291, but in the ASCII Output dialog box, select only the Rules check box.
- To import the design rules, follow the instructions to import an ASCII fileon page 290.

## Turning on Design Rule Checking
With *Online DRC*, you can enable live design rule checking as you work on your design. Online DRC prevents or reports design rule violations during interactive placement or routing.

Use Online DRC to constrain actions and avoid making design errors. You can run the Verify Design on page 1775 tool to search for and locate errors at any time.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- There are many design rules that are not checked by Online DRC. Some are only checked by SailWind Router (for example, Maximum number of vias) and others can only be checked as a post process by the Verify Design tool (for example, net Capacitance). Check the documentation and test the rule to ensure it works with Online DRC.
- Online DRC does not prevent you from moving objects in a flooded area. If you don't re-flood the area, Verify Design reports errors. If objects within a flooded area were moved, or thermal settings were changed since the original flooding, you need to flood the area again.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > Design categoryon page 1503.
- 2. In the Online DRC area, select a setting.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also initiate design rule checking using one of the Design Rule Checking modeless commands (drp, drw, dri, or dro). on page 1479

## Check Design Rules
You can perform a design rules check during interactive place and route operations, or after place and route operations are complete.

For more information, see "Turning on Design Rule Checking".

Use Verify Design to check for design rule violations after placement or routing, and report any violations in the work area and in a text file. For more information, see "Verify the Design".

## Restricting Heights on Component Layers
You can create a board height restriction to limit the height of components placed on the board.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot use a height restriction of 0 (zero) to prevent placement on a layer. A height restriction of 0 specifies no restriction. To prevent placement of all components on a layer, make the layer a Routing layer instead of a Component layer in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_59_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you want to have a visual cue that a board has a height restriction, use the procedure in "Restricting Heights in Areas of Component Layers" to create a keepout area over the entire layer.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A board height restriction does not prevent placement of a decal that has no geometry.height attribute.
- No warning is given if you create a restriction after a component that is taller than the height restriction has been placed. The violation will be caught, however, when you run a clearance check in Verify Design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item, then click the **Text and Lines** tab.
- 2. In the Board component height restriction area, enter the height restriction for the Top and/or Bottom layer.
- 3. Click **OK**.

**Results**

You will be unable to place components whose geometry.height attribute value is greater than the specified height restriction.

Restricting Heights in Areas of Component Layers

## Restricting Heights in Areas of Component Layers
You can create a board height restriction to limit the height of components placed in an area of the board.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A board height restriction does not prevent placement of a decal that has no geometry.height attribute.
- No warning is given if you put a keepout over an already-placed component that is taller than the height restriction. The violation will be caught, however, when you run a clearance check in Verify Design.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Layer list of the Standard Toolbar, select a component layer.
- 2. Create a keepouton page 465 in the area of the board where you want to restrict component height.
- 3. In the Add Drafting dialog box, in the Restrictions area, select the Placement and the Component height check boxes.
- 4. Type the height restriction in the box.
- 5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

You will be unable to place components whose geometry.height attribute value is greater than the specified height restriction.

Restricting Heights on Component Layers

## Keepouts
*Keepouts* prevent the placement of design items within a specified area. Keepouts appear as one pixelwidth lines during interactive placement, cluster placement, routing, and other operations. The outer edge of design objects and board outlines/cutouts appear for use in clearance calculations against keepouts. Both the Online Design Rule Checking and Verify Design tools recognize keepouts as obstacles.

You can create keepouts in both the Layout Editor and the PCB Decal Editor. User interaction is the same for either; the only difference is the type of objects you can restrict.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_62_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

The three component type keepouts can only be created in the Layout Editor.

Creating Keepout Areas Modifying a Keepout

### Creating Keepout Areas
Create a keepout to define areas where design objects cannot be placed. You can create keepout areas using closed polygons (with or without arcs), circles, or rectangles. The current angle mode and design grid settings determine the placement of the lines.

**Note:**

When defining keepouts in the PCB Decal Editor, you can also assign keepouts to an <Opposite Side>. You cannot do this in the Layout Editor. Placement, Component Height, and Component Drill check boxes are unavailable in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, then click the **Keepout** button.
- 2. Right-click and click a draw mode for the type of shape to create.
- 3. Create a closed shape to define the keepout area.
- 4. In the Add Drafting dialog box on page 1054that appears, select restrictions.
- 5. Click the layer on which to place the keepout.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_62_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** When you choose layer assignments, restrictions not available for that layer are unavailable. For example, if you choose a non-placement layer, the Placement check box will not be available.

6. Click **OK**. The keepout is created. If you create other keepouts, they use the restrictions you set here as the default.

**Results**

The keepout is displayed with a widely spaced hatch filling the area. If the fill you are using for Copper or Copper Planes is similar and you find it difficult to distinguish them, you can change the direction of the keepouts to be the reverse in the "Hatch and Flood"on page 1511 options.

**Related Topics**

### Modifying a Keepout
You can change the size of a keepout just as you would any other drafting object: move an edge or corner, or change the diameter of a circle. You can also copy a keepout to another location and change its restrictions or layer assignments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the edge of a keepout, right-click and click the **Select Shape** popup menu item.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Drafting Properties dialog box, turn restrictions on or off and modify the layer settings. For more information, see "Drafting Object Properties."
- 4. Click **OK**.

![](/layout/guide/19/_page_63_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** You cannot modify a keepout that is part of a physical design reuse. If you try to, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.
