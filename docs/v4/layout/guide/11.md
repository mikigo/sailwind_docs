Creating a Board Cut Out

## Creating a Board Cut Out
Use the **Board Outline and Cut Out** button on the Drafting Toolbar to create a board cut out. You can create only one board outline per design, so use the same command and creation process for creating cut outs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot create a notch using a board cut out. To create a notch, edit the board outline instead.

**Prerequisites**

The board outlineon page 261 must exist before you can create a cut out.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Board Outline and Cut Out** button. Since a board outline already exists, the message "Board Outline exists. Would you like to create a Board Cut Out?" appears. Click **Yes** to continue.
- 2. Right-click and click the shape of your board cut out.
- 3. Draw your cut out. For specific shape instructions, see"Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object"on page 624, "Creating a Circle Drafting Object", "Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object".on page 623
- 4. To change the color of the board cut out, click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item. In the Other area, set the color of the Board Outline tile.

**Results**

A board cut out cannot intersect another cut out or the board outline. If intersections occur, the message "Selected point is outside the board area" appears in the Status Bar. If you move a cut out and it intersects another cut out or the board outline, the message "Board cut out intersects the board outline" appears.

## Importing a Board Outline and Cut Out from AutoCAD
You can import a board outline from a DXF file created in AutoCAD provided you meet certain preliminary requirements in the AutoCAD setup.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create a layer within AutoCAD entitled BOARD\_OUTLINE\_00.
- 2. Draw your board outline using the **Polyline** button in AutoCAD. Make sure you close the Polyline shape, and assign a real width to the closed polyline.

Only one polyline object can be used for the board outline since SailWind Layout only allows a single board outline shape.

If you did not create the board outline shape on the new layer, you can select the board outline, and within the Properties of AutoCAD, assign the shape to the BOARD\_OUTLINE\_00 layer.

- 3. If you do not require a cut out, simply save the file as a DXF format file and import into a blank SailWind Layout design file. If you have a cut out(s), proceed with the next steps.
- 4. Create a layer within AutoCAD entitled BOARD\_CUTOUT\_00.
- 5. Draw your cut out(s) using a closed Polyline for each cutout.

If you did not create the board cutout shape on the new layer, you can select the cut out(s), and within the Properties of AutoCAD, assign the cut out(s) to the BOARD\_CUTOUT\_00 layer.

- 6. Select the board outline and cut out(s), and make a Block out of them. In the Block Definition dialog box, name the block BOARD\_1.
- 7. Save the file in AutoCAD as a DXF format file and import into a blank SailWind Layout design file.

**Results**

- Did the board outline or cutout import as a 2D line? If so, it was not assigned to the correct layer. In AutoCAD, go into the object's properties and assign it to the correct layer.You can determine if the object imported as a board outline or a 2D line by its color. Check the color of the object against the color set for the Board Outline in the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box. (The color set for the Board Outline must be different than the color set for Lines.)
- If the import of the board and cutout does not proceed correctly, explode the block in AutoCAD, recreate it and save a new DXF file.
- Are you getting an error about a polyline that is not closed? In AutoCAD, edit the polyline and close it.

### Exporting the Board Outline into an ASCII File
You can share your board outline with another user who does not share your libraries. You can export the board outline into an ASCII file for import by the other user.

**Procedure**

- 1. Createon page 261 a board outline. If you have a design with a board outline, you can use this design; remove any extra line items so they are not included in the export in the next step.
- 2. Exporton page 291 to an ASCII file. In the ASCII Output Dialog Box, select the Lines check box only.
- 3. Importon page 290 the saved ASCII file into a new design.

### Adding the Board Outline to an Unsupported Start-up File
If you are consistently using the same board outline for your designs, add the board outline to a startup file and when you start a new design, the board outline is there by default. Export the board outline in an ASCII file along with other startup features, rename the file extension to *.stp*, and place the file in the start-up file directory for use as a start-up file.

For more information, see Unsupported Start-up Files in "Start-up Files".

**Procedure**

- 1. First, read the "Creating Start-up Fileson page 254" topic.
- 2. Follow the steps in "Exporting the Board Outline into an ASCII File" to create an ASCII file with the board outline and any other line items, stackup, rules, or other defaults you might want in your start-up file.
- 3. Rename the *.asc* file extension to *.stp* and place the file in the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version> \Settings* folder.
- 4. Follow the instructions in "Specifying the Start-up File" to use the start-up file for future designs.

## Moving a Board Cut Out
When you move a board cut out, avoid using the "Move by Origin" move preference.

**Procedure**

- 1. Check the Move Preference:
	- a. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
	- b. In the Options dialog box, click the Design categoryon page 1503.
	- c. In the Move preference area, select either "Move by cursor location" or "Move by midpoint". If the move preference is set to "Move by origin", the cut out may snap off screen since the pointer snaps to the origin of the board outline and not the cut out.
	- d. Click **OK**.
- 2. With nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Board Outline** popup menu item.
- 3. Shift-click the cut out to select the whole shape.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.

**Results**

The cut out attaches to the pointer so you can place it where you want.

If you move a cut out and it intersects another cut out or the board outline, the message "Board cut out intersects the board outline" appears.

## Creating and Adding Board Fiducials
*Board fiducials* are pads on the outer layers of the board surrounded by adequate soldermask clearances to allow for better visual contrast and increased recognition. Various steps of the board fabrication and assembly processes use board fiducials for positioning and alignment, most importantly during the automated placement of components. Automated vision systems on specialized processing equipment use fiducials as visual targets to align and calibrate the machines.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create a new decalon page 160 of a single pad stackon page 185 for the fiducial:
	- a. Define a pad on the top (mounted) layer and no pad on the inner or bottom (opposite) layers.
	- b. Add to this a soldermask opening two or three times the size of the pad on the top soldermask layer.
	- c. Next, add a pad the same size as the fiducial to the top assembly layer to help viewers of the assembly drawing orient the location of the components.
	- d. You can create a keepout around the fiducial to assure no other design objects on adjacent layers will interfere with the visual recognition of the fiducial by the automated systems.
- 2. Create a non-ECO Registered Parton page 232 for this new decal.
- 3. Add the new part using the Add Component button on the ECO Toolbar on page 821.
- 4. Place the fiducials around the edge of the board inside the board outline.

**Examples**

**Fiducial**

This example will provide the information needed to create a fiducial.

1. Create a new decal of a single pad stack for the fiducial using these suggested dimensions:

**Table 67. Usage Example - Fiducial**

| Layer                | Shape  | Size    | Description             |
|----------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Top (Mounted)        | Round  | 40 mils | Top pad                 |
| Solder Mask Top      | Round  | 80 mils | Solder mask to void     |
| Assembly Top         | Round  | 40 mils | Assembly ref. image top |
| All Layers (Keepout) | Round  | 80 mils | Component/via/routing   |
| Layer 20             | Circle | 80 mils | Courtyard outline       |

- 1. Create a non-ECO Registered Part for this decal and name it FIDUCIAL40 or some other descriptive name of your choice.
- 2. Add the new part using the **Add Component** button on the ECO Toolbar.
- 3. Place two fiducials at the extremities of the board in diagonally opposed corners 1/4 inch inside the board edges

## Creating and Adding Board Mounting Holes
Board mounting holes typically provided places to secure and support the printed circuit board in the device enclosure. Mounting holes usually fit with ANSI and ISO standard mounting hardware. Depending upon the specific requirements of the design, mounting holes may be plated or non-plated.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create a new decalon page 232 of a single pad stackon page 185 for the mounting hole:
	- a. Define a pad on the top (mounted) layer and the bottom (opposite) layer.
	- b. Define a pad on the inner (signal) layer and add a plane anti-pad definition to the pad.
	- c. Add soldermask openings for the pads on the top and bottom soldermask layers.
	- d. Next, add pads to the top and bottom assembly layer to help viewers of the assembly drawing find the location of the mounting holes.
	- e. You can create a keepout around the mounting hole to assure that there is adequate clearance for the fastener and any required tools.
	- f. Specify the drill size of the through hole.
	- g. If the mounting hole is to be plated, check the plated check box; if the mounting hole is to be unplated, leave the plated check box unchecked.
- 2. Create a non-ECO Registered Parton page 232 for this new decal.
- 3. Add the new part using the on page 821**Add Component** button on the ECO Toolbar.
- 4. Place the mounting holes at the required locations within the board outline.
