# Chapter 33 SailWind Router
This section discusses using SailWind Router in your design process. You can connect to SailWind Router from within the SailWind Layout environment. Once connected, you can launch a SailWind Router autorouting session or you can initiate Synchronization Mode where you can work interactively and simultaneously in SailWind Layout and SailWind Router.

## Synchronization Mode
Synchronization Mode links SailWind Layout and SailWind Router such that as you work in one program, you see the changes reflected in the other. For example, if SailWind Layout is the "active" program, changes made there are reflected in SailWind Router but you are restricted in what you can do in SailWind Router since it is the "inactive" application. When you are in Synchronization Mode, you can instantly switch between the two programs.

If an unsupported command is performed or an unsupported option is changed, the inactive program will become out of sync.

**Note:**

You must enable Synchronization modeon page 774 and then restart SailWind Layout before Synchronization mode takes effect.

Despite the synchronization, you must actively switch back to SailWind Layout in order to work on your design in SailWind Layout.

Automation can still be used; however, most Automation methods will not return any valuable results and will not make any changes in the database.

There are a few commands and options that are not supported in Synchronization mode. If you perform one of these commands, or change one of the options, SailWind Layout and SailWind Router become out of sync.

To re-synchronize the two programs, click the Layout button on the main toolbar in SailWind Router if SailWind Router is active; or click the Route button on the main toolbar in SailWind Layout if SailWind Layout is active.

**Unsupported commands**

- Changing a drafting object: copper, copper planes, text, 2D lines, keepouts, labels, board outlines, dimensioning. However, when drafting objects are attached to a component and the component is moved, it will not cause the programs to become out of sync.
- Changing rules
- Changing padstacks or layer definitions
- Importing ASCII files (or any other import)
- Verifying the design
- Changing reuses and clusters
- ECO or BGA operations
- Updating from the library
- Using the Decal Editor
- Inserting an OLE object
- Any operation that clears the Undo buffer; including Autorouting and large group moves

**Unsupported option changes**

- DFF
- DFT
- Verify Design
- Drafting
- Hatch and Flood
- Thermals
- ECO Options
- Via Patterns

## Enabling Synchronization Mode
Synchronization Mode links SailWind Layout and SailWind Router so that you see the design in both programs and can work in either tool without moving the design back and forth.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options Dialog Box, click the Synchronization categoryon page 1535.
- 3. In the Layout and Router Synchronization area, click Enable.
- 4. Switching to SailWind Router automatically places your design in SailWind Layout in DRC Off mode; the DRC mode in SailWind Router is not affected.

To restore the DRC mode when you switch back to SailWind Layout (to the setting that existed before switching to SailWind Router) click Restore DRC Mode on return. Depending on the size of your design, restoring the DRC mode may take a few minutes.

- 5. To receive a warning that your design is being placed into DRC Off mode when you switch to Synchronization Mode, click Warn about switching to DRC Off mode.
- 6. Click **OK**.
- 7. Restart SailWind Layout.

## Sending a Design to SailWind Router in Synchronization Mode
Use Synchronization Mode to quickly transfer your design to SailWind Router, but still keep your design open in SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

- 1. Enable Synchronization Modeon page 774.
- 2. Switch to SailWind Router using one of the following:
	- On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Route** button.
	- Click the **Tools > Router** menu item, and in the SailWind Router Link dialog box select an Action and click **Proceed**.

**Note:**

To exit Synchronization mode, close one of the programs. Since in Synchronization Mode the Layout button (on the SailWind Router Standard Toolbar) does not send your design to SailWind Layout and then close SailWind Router, you must close the application manually. However, if one of the programs is out of sync, make sure you save your changes if you want to keep them. For example, if you want to continue working in SailWind Layout, but no longer want to be in Synchronization Mode, close SailWind Router. When prompted, save your design.

**Results**

SailWind Router opens and your design is loaded. SailWind Layout is switched to DRC Off mode and is now the inactive program. Most menu items and commands are disabled or are read-only for the inactive program. As you work in SailWind Router, you will see the changes reflected in SailWind Layout. You can quickly switch between the two programs and continue to be in Synchronization Mode. Look at the status bar to quickly determine which mode the program is in: Active, Inactive, or Out of sync.

If an unsupported command is performed or an unsupported option is changed, the inactive program will become out of sync. To re-synchronize the two programs, if SailWind Router is active, click the Layout button on the main toolbar in SailWind Router; or if SailWind Layout is active, click the Route button on the main toolbar in SailWind Layout.

To turn off the display of licensing warnings when switching between SailWind Layout and SailWind Router, type the following text in the *Blazerouter.ini* file:

```
[Security]
```

```
DisplayWarnings=0
```
(You do not need to restart SailWind Router.)

## Autorouting Your Design Using SailWind Router
Using the link you can either run SailWind Router and automatically open the current design file in the foreground, so you can view the autorouter's progress, or you can run SailWind Router in the background.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Router** menu item.
- 2. In the SailWind Router Link Dialog Box, in the Action area, select the action you want to perform:

Autoroute in Background — Opens SailWind Router and SailWind Router Monitor, but runs SailWind Router in the background. Layout commands are disabled and a wait cursor shown until autorouting is completed or the Stop button is selected in the Router Monitor.

Autoroute in Foreground — Opens SailWind Router and SailWind Router Monitor, and runs SailWind Router in the foreground making it the active program.

- 3. In the Routing Strategy area, click **Setup** to set the autorouting strategyon page 777.
- 4. Set any required settings before autorouting:
- a. In the Options area, click one of the selections to specify which settings you want to configure and then click **Setup**.
- b. Repeat for other selections as required.
- 5. Click **Proceed**.

**Results**

If you clicked Run in Background, the SailWind Router Monitoron page appears, but SailWind Router does not appear on your desktop.

If you clicked Run in Foreground, the SailWind Router Monitoron page appears. SailWind Router also opens and automatically autoroutes the current SailWind Layout design.

## Setting up a Routing Strategy
Use the Routing Strategy dialog box to define a strategy for autorouting a design. A routing strategy is a detailed set of instructions that SailWind Router uses to complete the autorouting of your design. You can create very detailed sets of instructions that can precisely control the routing order of specific nets, net classes, layers and components.

The strategy defines the sequential operations to perform during autorouting, including:

- Passes that the autorouter should run, including the routing intensity, whether or not to protect the generated traces, and whether to pause after a pass completes.
- Order in which to autoroute nets, net classes, differential pairs, and matched length groups and components.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > SailWind Router** menu item.
- 2. In the SailWind Router Link Dialog Box, in the Routing Strategy area, click **Setup**.
- 3. In the Routing Strategy Dialog Box, in the Pass column, select the check box for each pass type you want to run. You can run any combination of passes.
- 4. In the Protect column, select those passes after which to protect the generated traces. This protects traces and glues vias that are completed during the corresponding pass type.
- 5. In the Pause column, select the pass after which you want to pause routing.

**Tip**

To continue after a paused pass when autorouting in the foreground, click the Resume Autorouting button on the Routing Toolbar in SailWind Router (or press the F10 key).

To continue after a paused pass when autorouting in the background, click the Stop button in the SailWind Router Monitor dialog box.

- 6. In the Intensity column, select the appropriate intensity. Intensity determines the effort and time the router can spend on a pass. You cannot set an intensity for the Center pass.
- 7. Set the routing order for the passes:
	- a. In the Routing Order column, click the field for the Pass Type you want to set.
	- b. At the bottom left of the dialog box in the Available list, select items to add to the Routing Order. The list is filtered between Components and different types of Nets using the "Select by" list above it. For example:
		- i. For the Fanout pass, click **Clear**, and then click the **Plane Nets** button to fanout only those nets.
		- ii. For the Patterns pass, click **Clear**. Set the "Select by" list to Nets and in the Available list choose any known bus nets in your design and then click the **Selected** button.
		- iii. For the Route pass, set the "Select by" list to Components and choose the most dense components in your design and then click the **Selected** button. In the Routing Order area, make sure the All Nets item is at the bottom of the routing order. If needed, use the down arrow to move it down in the order.
	- c. Use the Routing Order area buttons to delete and re-order the items.
- 8. Click **OK**.

**Results**

When you autoroute the design using SailWind Routeron page 776, the autorouter follows the routing order when routing your design.
