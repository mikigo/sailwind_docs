## Database Limits
As of PowerPCB 4.0, the database limits increased.

The following table shows the old and new database limits:

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_0_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** If your design uses these new limits, you may not be able to export it into a PADS-format ASCII file compatible with a previous version of the program. For more information, see "ASCII Format" in the *SailWind Layout Command Reference*.

**Tip**

Consider all limits of 32,768 and 16,777,216 as formal. Actual limits may be smaller due to memory limitations.

## The Selection Filter
The layout of a printed circuit board displays overlapping layers of objects and dense areas of design objects on each layer, making it difficult to select the object you want. Use the Selection Filter to help solve this problem.

Use the Selection Filter to specify the type of object and even the layer on which to select objects. The Selection Filter has two tabs, the Object and the Layer. As a shortcut, you can also use preset Selection Filter setups available on the shortcut menu.

There are three ways to use the Selection Filter. For more information, see the topics in this section.

Filtering Selection Using the Selection Filter Shortcuts Filtering Selection by Object Type in the Selection Filter Filtering Selection by Layer in the Selection Filter

### Filtering Selection Using the Selection Filter Shortcuts
Use the Selection Filter shortcuts to quickly set the Selection Filter to select items in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Ensure nothing is currently selected in the design. If something is already selected, the shortcut menu will not display the Selection Filter presets. To clear selection in the design, do one of the following.
	- Right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item.
	- Click in an empty area of the design space outside the board area if possible, since you could accidentally select a transparent object within the board area.
- 2. Right-click and click one of the selection filter presets.

**Results**

<span id="page-3-2"></span>In the Selection Filter dialog box, check boxes are selected according to the preset that you chose.

### Filtering Selection by Object Type in the Selection Filter
Use the **Object** tab of the selection filter to specify which type of objects you would like to be able to select in the design.

- 1. Click the **Edit> Filter** menu item.
- 2. In the Selection Filter dialog box, on the Object tabon page 1710, select the design and drafting items by selecting the appropriate object type check box(es).

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_4_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Tip** You can use the **Anything** or **Nothing** buttons to quickly select all or clear all check boxes.

- 3. Click **Close**.
- 4. Select your items in the design.

### Filtering Selection by Layer in the Selection Filter
Use the **Layer** tab of the selection filter to specify on which layer would like to be able to select objects in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Filter** menu item.
- 2. In the Selection Filter dialog box, on the Layer tabon page 1708, select the layers from the layer list by selecting the appropriate layer check box(es).

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_4_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** You can use the **Anything** or **Nothing** buttons to quickly select all or clear all check boxes.

- 3. Click **Close**.
- 4. Select your items in the design.

**CAUTION:**

Unlike the check boxes on the **Object** tab, those on the **Layer** tab are not altered by changing any of the Selection Filter presets on the shortcut menu. You must return to the **Layer** tab to re-enable selection of objects on the layer(s) you disabled. Disabling a layer for selection will prevent you from routing to the layer or placing objects on the layer.

## Object Selection
Most design work involves adding, modifying, and deleting items. SailWind Layout provides many ways to select items and two ways to edit items.

You can first select the objecton page 1842 to edit and then select the command, select mode; or you can first select the command and then select the object to edit, verb mode.

Verb mode attaches a command to the pointer and performs that command on any items subsequently selected. The advantage of using verb mode is that it automatically sets the selection filter to items that respond to the active command.

There are several ways to select objects:

- One at a time
- Several objects at once
- All objects within an area
- All objects of the same type

**Single Object Selection**

To select a single object, point to the object and click. The object becomes selected and highlighted. Any previously selected objects are no longer selected. If you click over empty design space, all previously selected objects are no longer selected.

But since you may click on a transparent design object and select it, right-click and click the **Cancel**  popup menu item to de-select any selected items.

**Multiple Object Selection**

To select multiple objects, press and hold the Ctrl key while you click over each item in sequence. Alternatively, you can drag a selection area around many objects and everything in the selection area will be selected according to your settings in the Selection Filteron page 114.

Start at one corner of the area and drag to the diagonally opposite corner. When you release the button, all objects contained within the rectangle are selected. If an object was not previously selected, it is added to the set of selected objects. If an object was previously selected, it is removed from the set of selected objects.

You can add additional objects to the selection or remove objects from the selection by pressing the Ctrl key while you click.

**Selection Tips**

If you try to select an object in a dense or crowded area, use the Selection Filter to disable other items for selection or use the Cycle command. For instructions, see "Cycle Picking". Alternatively, you can make area selection, and then right-click to choose the **Selected List** menu item. For details, see "Selecting  Objects by Selected List".

You can click the **Edit> Find** menu item to search for and select objects in the design. For more information, see "Object Finding".

The Project Explorer also enables you to select design objects. For instructions, see "Selecting Design Objects Using the Project Explorer".

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_5_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip**

The Drag Moves area in the **Global > General** tab of the Options dialog box can affect your ability to area select in dense designs. If a selected object starts to move when you area select, click **Cancel** from the shortcut menu and try starting in a different area. To disable drag moves, set the Drag Moves setting to No Drag Moves.

The following table shows how to use Shift or function key combinations to automatically select multiple items.

| Item to select                               | Key combination                       |

For instructions to select items in the two modes, see the following topics:

- Selecting Using Select Mode
- Selecting Using Verb Mode

Selecting Using Select Mode

Selecting Using Verb Mode

### Selecting Using Select Mode
You can apply various commands to an object when you select it first. This is also called *Object Mode*.

- 1. Point to the object and click. The selected item highlights.
- 2. Use one of the following:
- Right-click to open a popup menu of commands that are appropriate for the selected item.
- Click a toolbar button to start a command.
- Click a menu command.

### Selecting Using Verb Mode
When you select a command first, you are restricted to select only those design objects to which the command applies.

**Procedure**

1. Open one of the toolbars by clicking one of the following buttons on the Standard Toolbar. Each toolbar provides a specific set of additional buttons.

**Figure 11. Toolbar Buttons**

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_7_Figure_9.jpeg)

- 2. Press the Esc key before you click a button to make sure nothing is selected. If something is selected when you click a button, the command acts on the already selected item.
- 3. Click one of the buttons on the newly opened toolbar. The command attaches to the pointer and the Status Bar displays the command name. Now you can apply the command to objects that you select. When you move the pointer into the workspace, a small V appears on the pointer to show that the selected command is active - the pointer is in verb mode.
- 4. Select an object on which to perform the active command. An object is one discreet item in the design, such as a route segment or part. Click the **Select** button to cancel the command. Some commands work with area selection (multiple items). For example, the Move command or the Bus Route command.

**Examples**

On the Design Toolbar, click the **Spin** button. The small V attaches to the pointer within the workspace. Select a component. The component is in Spin Mode. Indicate a new orientation or press the Esc key to cancel the spin.

## Cycle Picking
When you cannot easily select the object you want because several objects occupy the same location use cycle picking.

- 1. Move the pointer over the object to select, and click.
- 2. If you did not select the correct object press the Tab key. Alternatively, you can click the **Cycle**  button on the Standard Toolbar, or click **Cycle** on the **Edit** menu, or right-click and click the **Cycle**

popup menu item. Any of these actions deselects the currently selected object and selects a new object at the same location within the pick radius.

3. You can continue to click the **Cycle** button to cycle the current selection through all objects at the pointer location.

## Selecting Objects by Selected List
Selected List displays what currently selected graphically, from which to choose the target object(s) you want. It is a more efficient choice for you to select object(s) in a dense or crowded area.

**Procedure**

- 1. Make area/multiple selection in dense areas of the design to include your target object(s).
- 2. Right-click, and click the **Selected List** popup menu item.
- 3. The Selected List Dialog Boxopens and lists all the objects currently selected in the workspace.
- 4. Select target object(s) in the list by checking the entry check box, which will be highlighted in the workspace simultaneously. You can also:
	- Add additional design objects to the list: Press and hold the Ctrl key while you click.
	- Remove the selected item(s) from the list by clicking **Remove**.

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_8_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:** To clear the list, you can also click in an empty area of the workspace.

- Filter objects by name: Type a wildcard or expressionin the Name box, and press the Enter key or click **Filter**. If you do not want to restrict the results with a filter, you can display all items by typing \* (asterisk).
- Fits the selected objects into the workspace by clicking **Fit to View**.
- Exports what currently in the list to a local CSV file by clicking **Export**.

For specific parameter description, see Table 200.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>5. Close the dialog box.

## Selecting Stitching Vias in a Shape
When you are working with vias in a design, you may want to select all of the stitching vias in a shape in order to modify them. You can select all stitching vias inside copper or a copper plane outline.

- 1. Select the copper or copper plane outline.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Select Stitching Vias** popup menu item.

## Isolated Stitching Via Selection
An isolated stitching via is not connected to any hatch outline or copper area. You can locate such vias by selecting them. You can select all isolated stitching vias in the entire design or just those associated with a specific net.

The search for isolated stitching vias ignores connections to CAM plane layers.

- **To select all isolated stitching vias in the design** With no object selected, right-click in the design area and click the **Select Isolated Stitching Vias** popup menu item.
- **To select isolated stitching vias associated with a net** Select a net then right-click and click the **Select Isolated Stitching Vias** popup menu item.

**Tip** When you verify your design, you can find isolated stitching vias by performing a Connectivity Check; however, you first need to set up that check. For information, see "Setting Up Checking for Isolated Stitching Vias."

## Running the Selection Report
The selection report is a quick way to determine everything you have selected in your design. This report is a great way to ensure that you are moving and editing exactly what you want.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

The Selection Report is available only when at least two objects of different types are selected in your design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select more than one type of object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Selection Report** popup menu item, or click the **View > Selection Report**  menu item.

**Results**

The *report.rep* file opens in your default text editor and displays everything you have selected in your design at this moment.

## Object Finding
Use the Find dialog box to find and select single or multiple objects by reference designator, part type, line width, or other aspect.

Find works two ways, depending on your selection modeon page 115:

- **Select mode**  Find ignores the Selection Filteron page 114 settings and selects whatever you ask it to.
- **Verb mode** Find only looks for items that are logical for verb mode.

A few of the Find By commands present more complex commands for finding.

Finding By Attribute Finding By Keepout Finding Fonts Finding By Physical Design Reuse Finding By Test Point Types Finding by Thermal Attributes Finding by Hatch Outline Finding by Isolated Hatch Outline

### Finding By Attribute
You can find objects by attribute name or attribute value.

**Procedure**

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the objects to highlight.
- 2. Click the **Edit> Highlight** menu item to show the object as highlighted.

The highlight color from the Display Colors Setup Dialog Boxis applied to highlighted objects.

If you selected the object afterwards, it loses its highlighting.

3. To remove the highlighting from the object, select the object and click the **Edit> Unhighlight** menu item.

## Measurement
You can measure clearance distances or objects in your design using two modeless commands.

Using Quick Measure Using Quick Length

### Using Quick Measure
Use the Q modeless command to measure using a dynamic ruler or measuring stick.

**Procedure**

- 1. Locate your pointer at the starting location of your measurement. Without further movement of the pointer, type the Q Modeless Commandon page 83 and then type Enter.
- 2. Move the pointer in any direction and a line is drawn indicating the span of your measurement. Three measurement values are displayed as you move the mouse pointer.
	- **dx**  Displays the delta measurement along the x axis.
	- **dy**  Displays the delta measurement along the y axis.
	- **d**  Displays the delta of the euclidean measurement between the start and end point.
- 3. When finished, press the Esc key to exit the Quick Measure mode.

### Using Quick Length
Use the QL modeless command to measure routed objects you have selected in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a net, pin pair, or one or more routed segments in the design.
- 2. Type the QL Modeless Commandon page 83 and then press the Enter key. The measurement of the selected route objects is given in a *Layout.err* report file which opens.

## Cut, Copy, and Paste Commands
Use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands just as you would in any other Windows software. You can paste the same copy repeatedly; it remains on the clipboard until you overwrite it with a new copy or cut action. You can also paste into a different design.

While the cut, copy, and paste commands function as you would expect in the Windows OS, these commands also perform uniquely in specific situations:

- **Cut, Copy, and Paste support attributes** When you cut, copy, or paste objects their attributes are cut, copied, and pasted with them. Attribute labels are also cut, copied, and pasted with the objects to which they are assigned.
- **Cut, Copy, and Paste also support physical design reuses** You can copy only one physical design reuse at a time. When you copy a physical design reuse and paste it into a different design, the reuse file is compared against the current design to detect possible reference designator, layer, decal, and net-name conflicts. This comparison will also detect other errors and warnings, as described in "Process of an Added Physical Design Reuse".
- **Cut, Copy, and Paste a group** When you paste a group, an error may appear in one of the Trace Copy dialog boxes. For more information, see the "Trace Copy Dialog Box" topic. The Group editing optionson page 1503 also affect this.
- **Pasting**  You can only paste items in DRC Off mode.
- **Copy Traces, Traces and Vias, or Routed Pin Pairs Only** When you select and copy a trace or a trace and via combination, you start a specialized operation that immediately attaches a copy of the selected routing to the pointer and lets you repeatedly paste with a mouse click. This function bypasses the paste command and automatically adds the design object to the pointer and allows you to paste with design rule checking enabled.
- **Capture an Area as a Bitmap Image**  You can use the **Edit> Copy as Bitmap** menu item to define a rectangular area from which to copy graphics information to the Clipboard as a bitmap image, which you can use in other files and documents. For instructions, see "Copying a Bitmap".
- **Copying and Pasting in ECO mode**  Any addition to the design that would force updating the netlist or part list must take place in ECO mode. Use the ECO Options Dialog Boxto target and direct the *.eco* file. If something is in the buffer that is not in the current part list or netlist, and you try to paste outside of ECO mode, SailWind Layout prompts you to enter ECO mode to complete pasting.
- **Copy Multiple Selections**  You can copy and paste multiple or mixed selections, or different item types on different layers using a selection rectangle. You can also build extended selections. For example, you can use a selection rectangle to copy an SMD part, its via fanouts, and an associated dimensioning item that was assigned to a documentation layer. You can only select items that appear on screen. You can copy the selected items to the Clipboard, retaining their layers and relative positions.
- **Paste Multiple Selections**  When the Clipboard holds multiple selections comprised of some ECO and some non-ECO registered items, Paste operates differently depending on whether you are in ECO mode. If you paste in ECO mode, all items can be pasted. Part reference designators are added sequentially. If you are not in ECO mode, you can paste only non-ECO registered items.

## Delete Command
Like the Copy and Paste operations, the Delete command is sensitive to whether you are in ECO mode. When the ECO Toolbar is not open, you can press the Delete key to unroute selected segments, pin pairs, or nets, leaving the connections intact.

![](/layout/guide/4/_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot delete physical design reuses that contain glued components or protected routes.

When the ECO Toolbar is open, you can use Delete to completely remove parts or nets from the design. You can remove any non-ECO items like copper, lines, or text normally. You can also unroute routed traces normally. If you delete a group of ECO and non-ECO items, or combined ECO items (parts and pin pairs or nets), confirmation prompts, one for each item, will appear sequentially.

## Copying a Bitmap
Define a rectangular area to copy graphics information as a bitmap image. Then you can switch to another application, Microsoft Word for example, and use the Paste command to insert the bitmap into a document.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Copy as Bitmap** menu item.
- 2. Area selecton page 118 the area to copy. All visible items in the rectangle including the background, dot grid, and color, are copied.
- 3. Open the application in which you want to place the bitmap and paste to place the image.

**Tip** You can also insert the picture with the **Paste Special** menu item in products that support this feature.

## Object Snap
You can snap to specified types of objects instead of snapping to the grid when you use the Q (Quick Measure) modeless command, perform any drafting modification, or perform any component placement command.

This includes:

- Add new drafting shape (of any type)
- Modify existing drafting shape (moving a corner or edge)
- Add a new corner to an existing drafting shape
- Split the edge of an existing drafting shape
- Move an entire drafting shape or group of shapes
- Add a new component
- Add a new stitching via
- Move a component or via
- Add a terminal in the Decal Editor
- Move a terminal in the Decal Editor

During all these procedures, the **Snap to Objects** menu item and the **Snap to** sub-menu of object types can be found on the popup menu. You can also control object snapping using the OS Modeless Commands, or the Object Snap optionson page 1540.

You can enable the display of markers to indicate the different types of snapping points in the Object Snap optionson page 1540.

The snapping to objects takes precedence over snapping to the grid if Snap to grid is enabled for the Design grid when the pointer is within the Snap radius.

If there is more than one object type in the vicinity of the Snap radius, the object type with the highest precedence is selected. The order of precedence is the order in which the object types appear in the Object Snap optionson page 1540. You can always filter out the types of objects to snap to if there are conflicts.

You can snap to points on the following design objects as long as they are visible in the design:

- drafting items (2D lines, coppers, keepouts, board outline, dimensioning lines)
- pins
- vias
- components
