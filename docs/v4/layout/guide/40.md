## Dimensioning
Dimensioning measures distances or angles on points you select, creates a text string containing the measured value, and creates the associated extension lines and arrows. This information is considered mechanical documentation for PCB designs.

The following table shows the setup options that let you match existing drafting standards and control how to add new dimensions.

| Option          | Description                                                                                                                                               |

**Table 130. Dimensioning Set Up Options**

Dimensioning also lets you create Baseline dimensions for annotating multiple items from the same starting point. Use Continue to create daisy-chained dimensions.

**Tip** You can use Dimensioning within the PCB Decal Editor. However, saving the decal converts dimensions to 2-D lines and text.

**Dimensioning Modes**

All of the various data items, routes, parts, and drafting items in SailWind Layout are referred to as objects. For dimensions, the extension lines, dimension lines, arrows, and text strings that make up dimensions are called dimension elements. Collectively, they create a dimension object.

![](/layout/guide/40/_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** When selecting and modifying, the software considers dimension lines as part of the arrows.

The following lists examples of how you can combine these separate elements to indicate dimensions:

- The standard, or default, dimension is comprised of lines extending from each point of measurement, a dimension line with arrows at each end running between the extension lines, and a text string identifying the length.
- Datum line dimensions are comprised of one extension line and one text string.
- Leader line dimensions consist of a dimension line with an arrow at one end and a text string at the other end. This category includes radius type dimensions.

You can combine dimension elements in various ways to create a dimension object. Many of the modification commands use these combinations, for example:

- You can select the entire dimension object from one of its selected elements using Select Parent.
- If you open the Properties of a selected dimension element, a Parent button appears in the subsequent dialog box. Click the **Parent** button to consider the entire dimension object for modifications.

## Dimensioning Process
The Dimensioning Toolbar provides quick access to tools for dimensioning your design. The Dimensioning Toolbar is also available in the PCB Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button to display the Dimensioning Toolbar.
- 2. Set your preferences for dimensions on the Options dialog box > **Dimensioning** category.

Give specific attention to the Layers where the dimensioning objects are added. For more information, see "Dimensioning Optionson page 1520."

![](/layout/guide/40/_page_1_Picture_18.jpeg)

Text and lines added to electrical layers will be fabricated in copper! Select a documentation layer for documentation objects.

3. Before attempting to dimension a design object, set the selection filter to the type of object for dimensioning.

For more information, see "The Selection Filter."

4. Based on the type of object to be dimensioned, select a dimensioning button.

For more information, see "Creation of Dimensions."

5. If you are creating multiple linear dimensions, right-click and click one of the measurement styles.

For more information, see "Selecting a Dimension Measurement Style."

6. Based on the dimension you are creating and line widths of extension lines and objects in the design, you may need to select a difference edge preference. Right-click and click one of the Edge Preferences.

For more information, see "Setting an Edge Preference."

7. Unless you are dimensioning a single basic object, you may need to manually identify the points to dimension. Right-click and click one of the Snap Modes.

For more information, see "Snap Mode for Dimension Points."

- 8. Select the object to dimension and then click to place the dimension.
- 9. When finished dimensioning, click the **Select** button to end dimensioning operations.

## Creation of Dimensions
You can create dimensions automatically and manually with the dimensioning tools. If a design object is in a selected state when a dimensioning button is clicked, one item is dimensioned. After dimensioning the first item, you select the next data item, and then click the button again.

![](/layout/guide/40/_page_3_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Note:**

Dimensioning modes are sticky, allowing you to select and dimension additional data items. To exit a dimensioning mode, click the **Select** button on the toolbar, or click **View > Toolbars > Dimensioning Toolbar** menu item to close the toolbar.

Adding Dimensions with Auto Mode Adding Horizontal Dimensions Adding Vertical Dimensions Adding Aligned Dimensions Adding Rotated Dimensions Adding Angular Dimensions Adding Arc or Circle Dimensions Adding Leader Line Dimensions

### Adding Dimensions with Auto Mode
Auto mode automatically establishes the orientation of newly added dimensions. If you select a line segment with Auto active, the system measures the length of the line segment and adds a dimension line parallel to the selected line. Auto is similar in functionality to Aligned mode except that Auto does not allow the selection of individual points. Snap mode is unavailable while you use Auto.

Auto dimensions arcs and circles in the same manner; click **Auto** and select the arc or circle to dimension. The advantage to using Auto mode is that you can create dimensions for line segments and/or arcs without having to switch modes.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, then on the Dimensioning Toolbar, click the **Auto** button.
- 2. Select the line segment or arc you want to dimension.

An image of the dimension is attached to and moves with the pointer to locate the dimension line.

3. Click to indicate the location for the dimension line.

**Restriction:**

Snap Mode is unavailable for Auto dimensioning since this option only works with selected line segments.

### Adding Horizontal Dimensions
Horizontal mode creates dimensions with the dimension line always being in a horizontal orientation, X direction.

Selected line segments that exist at an angle have their base distance measured. Line segments in a pure vertical orientation, Y direction, cause an error message to appear. The same orientation rules apply for points entered through the pointer.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Horizontal** button.
- 2. If needed, select a Snap Modeon page 925 and Edge Preferenceon page 923 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the line segment to dimension, or indicate two points and the dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line and then you can continue to dimension additional data items.

### Adding Vertical Dimensions
Vertical mode creates dimensions with the dimension line always being in a vertical orientation, Y direction.

Selected line segments that exist at an angle have their height distance measured. Line segments in a pure horizontal orientation, X direction, cause an error message to appear. The same orientation rules apply for points entered through the pointer.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Vertical** button.
- 2. If needed, select a Snap Modeon page 925 and Edge Preferenceon page 923 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the line segment to dimension, or indicate two points and the dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line, and then you can dimension additional data items.

### Adding Aligned Dimensions
Aligned creates dimensions with the dimension line at the same angle as the selected line or points. Aligned is similar to Auto, but in addition to dimensioning selected lines, Aligned allows you to indicate two points that identify the measurement locations.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Aligned** button.
- 2. If needed, select a Snap Modeon page 925 and Edge Preferenceon page 923 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the line segment to dimension, or indicate two points and the dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line and then you can dimension additional data items.

### Adding Rotated Dimensions
Rotated mode creates dimensions similar to Aligned mode, but offers the additional flexibility of rotating the entire dimension object by a specified number of degrees. This feature is convenient when several dimensions exist in one location, because it allows you to offset some dimensions for easy viewing.

When dimensioning in Rotated mode, the system displays a prompt window specifying the current angle, with zero being in the positive Y axis (toward the top of the work area). You can type a different value to rotate and offset the entire dimension object. Positive values rotate counterclockwise; negative values rotate clockwise.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Rotated** button.
- 2. If needed, select a Snap Modeon page 925 and Edge Preferenceon page 923 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the line segment to dimension, or indicate two points.
- 4. Type the rotation value you want to use and click **OK** and the dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 5. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line and then you can dimension additional data items.

### Adding Angular Dimensions
Angle mode measures and dimensions an angle in degrees. You can specify this angle by two line segments, a line segment and two points, or four points.

These settings are controlled by the available Snap modeson page 925.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Angular** button.
- 2. If needed, right-click and click a Snap Modeon page 925 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the lines to dimension, or indicate two points to define the angle and the angular dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line, and then you can dimension additional data items.

### Adding Arc or Circle Dimensions
Arc creates dimensions that measure and document the size of arcs or circles, with the calculation being the radius or the diameter.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Arc** button.
- 2. If needed, right-click and click an Edge Preferenceon page 923 popup menu item.
- 3. Select the arc or circle to dimension and the radial dimension dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to indicate a location for the dimension line, and then you can dimension additional data items.

**Tip** Arc mode works best when you select the "Manual position" check box in the Displacement area of the Options dialog box > Dimensioning category > Text subcategory on page 1522. This lets you create a leader line effect for documented arcs and circles.

### Adding Leader Line Dimensions
Leader creates a standard pointer to the selected information or point. It is simply a line with an arrow at one end and a user-specified text string at the other.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Dimensioning Toolbar** button, and then on the Dimensioning Toolbar click the **Leader** button.
- 2. Right-click and click a Snap Modeon page 925 popup menu item if you are creating the leader from a specific point, such as the midpoint of the selected line.
- 3. Select the line to dimension, or click to indicate a point for the arrow and a line with an orthogonal corner dynamically attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Click to add a vertex and anchor the leader line, and then double-click to complete the leader line.
- 5. Type a text string for the leader line and click **OK**.
