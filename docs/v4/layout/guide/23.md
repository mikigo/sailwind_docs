## Supported Design Objects for Data Exchange
MCAD Collaborator supports the processing and exchange of design objects using IDX Schema 2.0 or 3.0 formats.

The following tables list various design objects and whether or not they are supported for collaboration in IDX Schema 2.0 or IDX Schema 3.0.

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_0_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot collaborate by applying an IDX Schema 3.0 baseline file and then export an IDX Schema 2.0 proposal from that baseline.

| Design Object                                | IDX 2.0 |  |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|--|
| Single Boards                                |         |  |

| Component Pins/Pin Holes/Mounting Holes               |         |  |
| Export one location of component pin through baseline | yes     |  |

**Table 105. Objects Supported in IDX Schema 2.0(continued)**

For IDX 3.0, objects are supported for different collaboration processes:

- **Export**  means you can export this data in IDX 3.0 format and save it as a baseline file.
- **Collaborate**  means you can import and export these objects. The Collaborator tracks them so you can send and receive updates (additions, deletions, changes) on the objects.

**Guidelines for Using Data Exchange Objects**

Board Outlines/Board Thickness:

• MCAD Collaborator shows a different board thickness than the stackup thickness. The Collaborator does not include soldermask in the thickness calculation so it represents proper part mounting (parts actually mount on the copper). The stackup thickness, minus the thicknesses of the soldermask, should equal the board thickness shown in MCAD Collaborator.

Component Pins/Pin Holes/Mounting Holes:

• The IDX format contains information on the location of Pin One for a component.

The Pin One coordinates are shown in the Properties section. The report of the coordinate location of Pin One is relative to the part origin, not the board origin. This is used to assist in aligning models.

## Collaboration Workflow Diagram
The typical collaboration workflow involves setting up a collaboration session, establishing a common design baseline, and then exchanging mechanical change requests.

You start the exchange process by opening a collaboration session and submitting a baseline data file to the mechanical design team (or they start the process by submitting their baseline file to you). The baseline and change data files are in IDX format. The baseline file updates the design with the changes; you do not have the option of rejecting the proposed changes in a baseline file. The side receiving a proposal has the option of either accepting or rejecting the proposed changes. Either side can then create and submit additional proposals by sharing new change data files.

You exchange the data files either by email or by storing them in a common directory accessible by both teams. Either team can initiate a change, and the change request is approved or rejected by the other team. MCAD Collaborator saves and tracks the status of each change request so you have a continuous record of what was done. Once a change request has been sent and received, you can close the collaboration session.

Launching the [Collaboration](#page-4-0) Tool

## Launching the Collaboration Tool
Launch the collaboration tool from the SailWind 3D window within SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

1. From within a design in SailWind Layout, open SailWind 3D (**View > SailWind 3D**).

SailWind 3D opens and displays the 3D General toolbar.

2. Open the MCAD Collaborator by clicking on the **MCAD Collaborator** button on the toolbar.

**Results**

You are ready to set up a collaboration session.

**Related Topics**

[Setting Up a Collaboration Session](#page-4-1)

## Setting Up a Collaboration Session
Before you transmit changes, set up a collaboration session and define how you want to exchange data with the mechanical design team.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• You must name (or rename) all components and part names so they do not contain spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. If you send a data file to the mechanical design team that has a space or a non-alphanumeric character in a name, those characters are automatically replaced with underscores. These automatic changes in the names are then marked as modifications even though no design change has actually occurred.

**Procedure**

- 1. In MCAD Collaborator, expand the Communication section.
- 2. In the Write Options section, choose the desired output and Email notification options from the dropdown lists.
- 3. Choose one of the following from the Data Transfer dropdown list to define how you want to exchange the baseline and change request files:

| If you want to                        | Do the following                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exchange data files by                | 1. Choose File from the dropdown list.                                                                                                                         |
| storing them in a shared<br>directory | 2. In the Data Path text box, enter the path name for the<br>directory where you want to store the data exchange<br>files (or browse to locate the directory). |

| If you want to               | Do the following                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exchange data files as email | 1. Choose Email from the dropdown list.                                                          |
| attachments                  | 2. Choose either Outlook or SMTP from the Email<br>Server dropdown list.                         |
|                              | 3. Enter the appropriate contact information in the<br>Receiver Info and Sender Info text boxes. |

- 4. Click **Filter objects** to open the Object Filter dialog box.
- 5. In the Component Options section, do the following to specify how to generate component data:
	- Check "Write Mounting Holes"to generate mounting hole data as part of the decal.
	- Check "Write Pin Holes"to generate pin hole data as part of the decal.
	- Under Replace 0 Height Components With, check "Top or Bottom Copper Thickness"or enter a custom height.

**Note:**

The collaboration exchange may not transmit zero height values correctly. By defining a default height for zero height components, you avoid potential errors that may appear on the mechanical design side of the exchange.

- 6. In the Board Options section, check Write Cutouts (Contours and Cavities) to include cutouts.
- 7. In the Collaboration Objects Filter list, filter what is displayed in the Collaboration Data list by checking the desired object types. (Unchecked object types will not appear in the Collaboration Data list.)
- 8. Click **OK** to save the Object Filter settings and close the dialog box.

**Note:**

If you made changes to the Collaboration Objects Filter list, the **Update Tree Data** button in MCAD Collaborator turns yellow. Click **Update Tree Data** to update the Collaboration Data list.

9. (Optional) In the Scheme section, click **Save** and enter a scheme name to save the settings you define so you can reuse them later in other designs.

The Communication and Object Filter settings are saved as a scheme in the directory you specify.

**Results**

The Collaboration Data list displays the design objects you checked in the Objects Filter list.

The collaboration settings are stored with your design project.

You are ready to send a baseline request.

## Sending a Baseline Request
Start a collaboration session by creating and sending a baseline request to the mechanical design team.

The baseline request establishes a common database that is shared between the PCB design team and the mechanical design team so that both are synchronized. Future change requests are referenced against the baseline data.

**Prerequisites**

• A collaboration session has been set up that defines how the request information is exchanged. See ["Setting Up a Collaboration Session"on page 565.](#page-4-1)

**Procedure**

- 1. In MCAD Collaborator, choose Baseline from the File Type Selector dropdown list.
- 2. Click **Object Filter** to open the Object Filter dialog box.
	- a. Check the Component Options you want to apply.
	- a. In the Collaboration Objects Filter list, filter what is displayed in the Collaboration Data list by checking the desired object types. (Unchecked object types will not appear in the Collaboration Data list.)
	- a. (Optional) In the Board Options section, uncheck "Write Cutouts (Contours and Cavities)"to send only the Board Outline without cutout and contour data.
	- a. Click **OK** to apply the settings and close the Object Filter dialog box.

|  | Note: |
|--|-------|
|  |       |

If you made changes to the Collaboration Objects Filter list, the **Update Tree Data** button in MCAD Collaborator turns yellow. Click **Update Tree Data** to update the Collaboration Data list with the objects you checked in the Object Filter dialog box.

The Properties section for the main design item shows the File type as "Baseline" and the Status as "To be sent".

The status bar reads "Ready" and is green.

3. In the Collaboration Data list, check the objects you want to include in the baseline; uncheck the objects you want to exclude.

4. Click **Send**.

MCAD Collaborator generates the specified PCB data.

**Results**

The baseline request file is saved and appears in the History section.

The status bar reads "Baseline sent...Ready to send or receive more changes" and is green.

If you enabled email notification, the mechanical design team receives your baseline request.

**Related Topics**

[Receiving a Baseline Request](#page-7-0)

[Creating and Sending a Change Request](#page-8-0)

## Receiving a Baseline Request
If you receive a baseline request from the mechanical design team, you must accept the entire baseline database as it is submitted to you so you can proceed with the collaboration session.

The baseline establishes a common database that is shared between the PCB design team and the mechanical design team so that both are synchronized. Future change requests are referenced against the baseline data.

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_7_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Note:**

The MCAD Collaborator monitors the shared directory where the baseline files are stored and updates the Files section automatically whenever a new change request file (baseline or proposal) is placed in the directory.

**Procedure**

1. In the Files section of MCAD Collaborator, select the baseline file.

The Collaboration Data section shows a list of the design objects contained in the baseline file.

- 2. (Optional) For detailed information about a design object, select it and review the properties for that object in the Properties section.
- 3. Click **Apply**.

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_7_Picture_21.jpeg)

**Note:**

If a baseline has a DRC error, a warning message appears. You can proceed and apply items that partially succeed instead of failing the entire transaction. If you proceed, the MCAD and ECAD baseline files become out-of-sync.

**Results**

Your design database is updated with all of the changes contained in the baseline file. Error messages and processing reports appear in the Message Window.

The baseline file moves to the History section.

The status bar reads: "Baseline applied. Ready to send or receive more changes"and is green.

## Creating and Sending a Change Request
You can make changes to the placement and objects in your design then send a change request to the mechanical design team that describes the proposed changes.

**Prerequisites**

• A baseline file has been exchanged and accepted.

**Procedure**

- 1. In MCAD Collaborator, choose Proposal from the Proposal Type dropdown list.
- 2. Click **Update tree data** .

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_8_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Note:** Any time you make a change in the PCB design, the **Update tree data** button turns yellow to indicate that the data in MCAD Collaborator is out-of-sync and needs to be udpated.

MCAD Collaborator generates the revised PCB data with any changes you have made and shows the changes in the Collaboration Data list.

The Properties section shows the File type as "Proposal", the Status as "To be sent", and the File Name as "proposal\_nn".

- 3. (Optional) Do the following to limit the Collaboration Data list to only the types of objects you want to display:
	- a. Click **Filter objects** to open the Object Filter dialog box.
	- b. In the Collaboration Objects Filter list, check only the types of objects you want to display in the Collaboration Data list, then click **OK**.

The **Update tree data** button turns yellow to indicate that the list needs updating.

- c. Click **Update tree data** to update the Collaboration Data list and show only the object types you selected in the Collaboration Objects Filter list.
- 4. In the Collaboration Data list, check the objects you want to include in the proposal; uncheck the objects you want to exclude.

5. Click **Send**.

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** If you want to abandon the proposal after sending it, click **Abandon**. This cancels the proposal file and changes its Status to "Abandoned"in the History section.

**Results**

The proposal file is submitted to the mechanical design team for their approval or rejection. Error messages and processing reports appear in the Message Window.

The proposal file appears in the History section.

The status bar shows: "Proposal sent. Awaiting response" and is yellow.

You can continue to make additional design changes or process other change requests sent to you from the mechanical design team. (You cannot send a new proposal until you have processed previous proposals and any responses you receive from the mechanical design team.)

[Sending a Baseline Request](#page-6-0)

## Reviewing and Applying a Change Request
After you receive a change request (proposal) from the mechanical design team, preview the proposed changes and determine whether to accept or reject them.

The 3D View shows what has been added, modified, or deleted by highlighting the proposed changes.

**Prerequisites**

• A baseline file has been exchanged and accepted.

**Procedure**

1. In the Files section of MCAD Collaborator, select the proposal file you want to preview and validate.

The Collaboration Data section shows a list of the design objects contained in the proposal.

- 2. Click **Highlight/Unhighlight** to activate highlighting and enable animation of the selected changes.
- 3. In the Collaboration Data list, select the object you want to preview.

The 3D View shows an animated playback of the change you select.

**Tip** For more detailed information about the selected object, review the properties for that object in the Properties section. This shows a "From" / "To" comparison of the changes made to the object.

4. Based on what you see in the 3D View, determine if the change you previewed is acceptable.

| If you want to    | Do the following         |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Accept the change | Check the change item.   |
| Reject the change | Uncheck the change item. |

5. Repeat Steps 3 - 4 for each object in the Collaboration Data list.

**6. Click Apply.**

Your design database is updated and the items you checked are changed in your design.

|  |  | 1 |
|--|--|---|

**Note:** If a change creates a DRC error, you are notified and the change is not applied. For example, the change would create an "unresolvable metal error". In this case, you would need to send a "Reject" response.

The proposal file moves to the History section.

The status bar shows: "Proposal Applied. Ready to send a response"and is green.

- 7. (Optional) Repeat Step 3, as needed, to review the changes that have been made and verify that the design has been updated correctly.
- 8. Click **Send**.

A *response\_nn.idx* file is sent.

**Results**

If you are collaborating by means of email notification, the mechanical design team receives a response telling them that you have processed the proposal. The email contains a file (*response\_nn.idx*) that the mechanical team loads to their design environment to see the changes.

The status bar shows: "Transaction complete. Ready to send or receive more changes"and is green.

[Controlling](#page-10-0) the Display of Different States

## Controlling the Display of Different States
Display different change items in a proposal based on their states to quickly determine the items to accept.

You can control which objects appear in the Collaboration Data list of MCAD Collaborator according to their status within a proposal file. You can also highlight a selected object in the SailWind 3D window to locate it and analyze its impact.

For example, you can choose to view only those objects in a change request that are added, and not view objects that are deleted or changed. This helps you evaluate a proposed change request more efficiently by focusing on only one state at a time.

**Procedure**

1. In the Files section of MCAD Collaborator, select the proposal file you want to review.

The Collaboration Data section shows a list of the objects contained in the proposal file.

![](/layout/guide/23/_page_11_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** You can manage the files in the Files section in the following ways:

- Select a file and choose **Clear** from the popup menu to remove it from the Files list.
- Choose **Clear All** from the popup menu to remove all of the files from the Files list.
- Choose **Refresh** from the popup menu to update the Files list.
- 2. In the display toolbar, click the appropriate buttons to toggle the display of objects in the Collaboration Data list:

| If you want to                                             | Do the following |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Show (or hide) all of the objects that have been added.    | Click            |
| Show (or hide) all of the objects that have been deleted.  | Click            |
| Show (or hide) all of the objects that have been modified. | Click            |

3. (Optional) Click , then select an object in the Collaboration Data list that you want to preview in the 3D View.

The selected object is highlighted in the 3D View to help you locate it more quickly in the design.
