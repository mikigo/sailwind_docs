## Layer Modes
SailWind Layout supports two layer modes.

Supported layer modes are as follows:

- **Default layer mode (up to 30 layers)**  can consist of up to a maximum of 30 electrical layers or a combination of electrical and nonelectrical layers. In default layer mode, you can only import, add, or load other default layer mode items, such as files or library items, to your design. You cannot load increased layer mode objects into the default layer mode design.
- **Increased layer mode (up to 250 layers)**  can consist of up to a maximum 64 electrical layers and 186 nonelectrical layers. The total number of layers includes associated layers such as mask, silkscreen, drill drawing, and assembly layers

In increased layer mode, you can load both default and increased layer mode objects into your design. Changing from default layer mode to increased layer mode increases all nonelectrical layer numbers by 100. In default layer mode, layer number 20 is used for placement outlines. In increased layer mode, layer 120 is used for placement outlines. Layer 25 in default layer mode, or 125 in increased layer mode, was historically used for oversizing thermals and antipads for CAM planes prior to the CAM Plot Options for CAM Plane Layerson page 1641.

You do not have to convert existing default layer mode libraries, reuse files, or archived designs to increased layer mode. You can use existing library decals, drawings, and reuses that are saved in default layer mode for both default and increased layer mode designs. You can cut from a design in default layer mode and paste into a design in increased layer mode. If you make sure that you have consistent layer definition in libraries, reuses, and designs, no problems with layer matching will occur.

**Restriction:**

Once you change the design to increased layer mode, you cannot return to default layer mode.

![](/layout/guide/14/_page_1_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:**

You cannot export a design with more than 30 electrical layers to a SailWind Layout PADSformat ASCII file prior to version 4.0.

Either default or increased layer mode is specified in each design or design fragment such as *.pcb*, *.asc*, *.stp*, *.dxf*, *.reu*, and high speed *.edp* files, library decals and drawing items, copy/paste buffer, and external CAM documents.

## Special Functionality of Layers 20 and 25
During the evolution of the SailWind design environment, certain layers within the standard layer setup have been adopted for specific uses. These uses include special functionality assigned to Layer\_20 and Layer\_25.

**Layer 20 - Placement Outlines**

When components are placed on a board, it is desired to keep them separated by a specific clearance in order to prevent them from overlapping and creating potential unwanted connections between the copper features of the components. Since some component leads extend beyond the body of the components, a specific outline that includes the desired clearance can be added on Layer 20 to represent the maximum boundary of the component

This placement outline is:

- Commonly referred to as the placement (or nudge) outline sometimes called a component courtyard.
- Used to specify additional clearances around a component to accommodate specific requirements for specialized placement and rework equipment.
- Used by on-line DRC and Verify Design to check for placement outline spacing violations.This is in addition to the standard "Body to body" design rule clearance check.

**Tip** To check the outlines, in the Verify Design, Clearance Checking Setup dialog box, enable the Placement outline check box.

**Note:**

Though only one layer is specified to contain the placement outlines, SailWind Layout uses the component placement layer assignment (top or bottom) of each component to determine how to interpret and check outline clearances during design verification.

For more information, see "Creating a Placement (Nudge) Decal Outline"on page 197.

**Layer 25 3D Body Outlines**

Historically, when using CAM planes (negative planes), positive images of anti-pads would be created in the pad stack on Layer 25. The plane outline would also be added as copper or a 2D line on Layer 25 around the board outline to create a gap from the plane to the board edge. This data would be merged with the CAM layer when the output files were generated for the photo plotter (Gerber files). Over time, the software evolved and "custom thermals and anti-pads" functionality was extended to CAM planes thereby making the use of anti-pads on Layer 25 obsolete.

Layer 25 is currently used for 3D body outlines. If you would like to view your design in the 3D Viewer, and you do not have a 3D model available for the component, the system will attempt to extrude a 3D representation of the component from the data available in the pcb decal. The 3D Viewer will automatically look for a 3D body outline on Layer 25 to use for extruding the shape.

**Tip**

If no 3D body outline is present on Layer 25, the system will attempt to use the silkscreen image of the component as the basis for the shape extrusion.

By default, the Land Pattern Creator uses Layer 25 for 3D body outlines when generating PCB decals.

For more information, see "Choosing Between Split/Mixed and CAM Layers".

## Choosing Between Split/Mixed and CAM Layers
Solid planes can be represented in two waysâ€”positive and negative.

A positive plane is created by using solid polygons on a Split/Mixed layer to represent the area that you want filled with copper. Pads, vias, thermals, anti-pads and other design objects are subtracted from the solid area. This method most accurately represents how the actual plane will look at fabrication. When the image is sent to a photo plotter, a positive representation of the plane is created on the film.

In the past, the photo plotter would use a very small aperture to "paint" the solid areas. This typically required the photo plotter to create tens of thousands of line segments to represent the plane. The file size could become quite large and took a lot of time to process, both by SailWind Layout and the photo plotter.

A negative plane on a CAM layer is created by using the absence of data to represent the area that you want filled with copper and you then create positive images of the design elements (pads, vias,

**Layers Association of Component and Documentation Layers**

thermals, anti-pads) that you want to remove from the copper. When the image is sent to a photo plotter, only the positive images of the design elements to be removed are created on the film. The film is then photographically reversed to create the positive image used to fabricate the board. Using this process, the photo plotter only has to "paint" the areas where copper will be removed resulting in a much smaller file size and a substantial reduction in processing time.

Historically, when designs were sent to a photo plotter service bureau using very slow dial-up modems, file size was extremely important. Therefore, it was much more desirable to represent planes using the much smaller file sizes produced by negative (CAM) planes. In order to utilize this method, a CAM plane layer would be specified in SailWind to represent the plane, and then the positive images of antipads would be created as pads on Layer 25. This data would be merged with the CAM layer when the output files were generated for the photo plotter (Gerber files). The resulting files were compact, more economical to transfer and quicker to process. Unfortunately, these negative CAM planes had certain design restrictions that created potential risks in their use.

Though these negative image planes were quick to generate, they were designed for single net assignment and no routing. The framework for CAM planes was rudimentary and did not allow for custom thermals or anti-pads. Verification of CAM planes was severely limited and required a lot of manual checking to verify plane connectivity. Also, considering that the plane was represented by a negative image, the plane outline could not be drawn and a positive image object had to be added to layer 25 around the board outline to create the gap from the plane outline to the board edge.

Although "custom thermals and anti-pads" functionality has since been extended to CAM planes and the CAM plane functionality remains, it is outmoded by the advanced features available for planes on Split/ Mixed plane layers. Split/Mixed planes are quick to generate and process using today's computing power and modern laser photo plotters. Split/Mixed planes allow you to split the layer into multiple planes. They allow a mixed use of planes and routing with custom thermals, automatic back-off from traces and control of the shape of planes.

For more information about Split/Mixed plane features, see the features attributed to the Plane area in "Differences Between Copper Shapes and Copper Planes".

## Association of Component and Documentation Layers
Layer association outputs text, line, or shape items on manufacturing plots for the component layers, top or bottom.

When you associate a documentation layer on page 1189dedicated to a manufacturing plot type with a component layer, the CAM output Document Type selections automatically include the associated documentation layer items with the plot type. You can associate the following layer types with a component layer: Paste Mask, Solder Mask, Silkscreen, and Assembly.

**TrueLayer and Layer Association**

When you define the pad stacks of a decal, the default layers for the pad stack are universal - Mounted, Inner, Opposite. They can be used universally on either side of the board. The mounted side can be the top or bottom of the board and the opposite side is always opposite the mounted side. If you were to instead create a pad stack that used specific layers, when you flipped the component to the other side of the board, the pad stacks would not flip.

Although you might add a specific Solder Mask, Paste Mask, Silkscreen or Assembly layer to the pad stacks of a decal, the TrueLayer feature flips the layer information when a component is flipped to the bottom side of the board. For example, if you have a surface mounted device with only a pad stack definition on the Solder Mask Top layer, when you flip the device to the bottom layer, the definition from the Solder Mask Top layer gets moved to the Solder Mask Bottom layer. You do not need to define a pad stack definition for the Solder Mask Bottom layer in case the component gets flipped.

To disable the TrueLayer feature, see the "Software Launch Options" topic for instructions on command line options.

## Setting Up Layers
Set up your layers by first defining them in the Layer Setup dialog box.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item. The Layers Setup Dialog Boxappears.
2. Set the number of layers for the design and if needed:
	- Increase the total number of layers on page 315available to the design database.
	- Designate that this is a single-sided boardon page 316.
	- Increase the number of electrical layerson page 316.
3. Set up the outeron page 317 layers.
4. Set up the inneron page 318 layers.
5. Determine the visibility of non-electrical layerson page 319.
6. Definelayer and substrate thicknesson page 320.

## Increasing the Maximum Number of Available Layers
SailWind Layout features two layer modesâ€”default layer mode and increased layer mode. Should you choose to switch to the increased layer mode, you can raise the number of available layers.

For more information regarding the two modes, see "Layer Modes".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When you switch a design to increased layer mode, you cannot return the design to default layer mode.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item. The Layers Setup Dialog Boxappears.
2. Click **Max Layers**. The Increase Maximum Layer Number Dialog Boxopens.
3. Click **OK** to switch to increased layer mode.

**Results**

All documentation layer numbers from the 30 layer database are increased by 100. For example, if you started with a 12 electrical-layer design, the first documentation layer, layer 13, becomes layer 113.

## Designating a Board as Single-sided
You can only designate a board to be single-sided provided it has no more than two electrical layers.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item. The Layers Setup Dialog Boxappears.
2. Select the Single-sided board support check box.
3. Click **OK**.

**Results**

- Connectivity checking no longer reports connectivity errors for component pins with non-plated drill holes. Components and jumpers placed on the top layer are considered as connected to pads on the bottom layer with solder joints.
- In CAM output, all through-hole pins and vias are treated as non-plated regardless of the definition in pad stacks.

## Modifying the Number of Electrical PCB Layers
You can change the number of electrical layers in a design in either default-layer (30 layer database) mode or increased-layer (250 layer database) mode.

For more information, see "Layer Modes".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You can't modify the layer definition for electrical layers if a physical design reuse exists on the board.

**Prerequisites**

Before changing the number of electrical layers, delete all partial vias and their definitions from your design.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, click **Modify**. The Modify Electrical Layer Count Dialog Boxopens.
2. In the Modify Electrical Layer Count dialog box, type the new number of electrical layers within the specified range.
3. Click **OK**. The Reassign Electrical Layers Dialog Boxopens.
4. If necessary, reassign the electrical information on any existing electrical layer to a new layer. The new electrical layers are created in the database with default parameter values. For more information, see "Reassigning Electrical Layers".

5. Click **OK** to return to the Layers Setup dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/14/_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** If you increase your electrical layer count, and intend to use partial vias, you should also update your drill pairs layer settingson page 1337.

## Setting Up an Outer Layer
The outer layers of your design are the Top and Bottom layers. You can designate an outer layer as a component layer or non-component layer.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, select an outer layer. For example, select Top.
2. In the Name box, type the name of the layer. By default, the outer layer names are assigned as Top and Bottom. Rename the layer to something that lets you know what the layer is. For example, Top Component Layer 1.
3. In the Electrical Layer Type area, click Component if you want to allow components on the layer; otherwise click Routing. If you select Component, you can change the layer associations:
	a. Click the **Associations** button.
	b. In the Component Layer Associations Dialog Box, set the associations for each documentation layer type.

When a top or bottom layer is set as a component layer, you can associate, or otherwise map, which documentation layers go with the selected layer. Whatever layer associations are made here are used by CAM routines for output. For example, when you output a silkscreen for the top, any items on the documentation layer you associated for silkscreen are automatically added to the CAM document.

c. Click **OK**.
4. In the Layers Setup dialog box, click a Plane Type setting. If you select CAM or Split/Mixed Plane, you must assign the plane net(s) to the layer:
	a. Click the **Assign Nets** button. The Plane Layer Nets Dialog Boxappears.
	b. Click a net from the All Nets list.
	c. Click **Add** to move the net to the Assigned Nets list. You can also assign a net to other layers as required. For example, if you have multiple ground plane layers, you can assign your ground net to those multiple layers.
	d. If the layer is a Split Mixed Plane type, you can associate additional nets to the layer.
	e. Click **OK**.
5. In the Layers Setup dialog box, click a Routing Direction setting. You must assign a primary routing direction to all electrical layers. Nonelectrical layers are not assigned a routing direction. The routing direction affects the manual and autorouting performance. For example, if you select

Horizontal but most of the traces on the layer need to be vertical, route editing performance is slow. Also, selecting Any can adversely affect route editing performance.

6. Click **OK**.

## Setting Up an Inner Layer
The inner layers of your design are always electrical layers.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, select an inner layer. For example, select Ground Plane.
2. In the Name box, type the name of the layer. By default, SailWind Layout assigns the layer number as its name; for example, Inner Layer 2. Rename the layer to something that lets you know what the layer is; for example, Inner Signal Layer 2.
3. Click a Plane Type setting. If you select CAM or Split/Mixed Plane, you must assign the plane net(s) to the layer:
	a. Click the **Assign Nets** button. The Plane Layer Nets Dialog Boxappears.
	b. Click a net from the All Nets list.
	c. Click **Add** to move the net to the Assigned Nets list. You can also assign a net to other layers as required. For example, if you have multiple ground plane layers, you can assign your ground net to those multiple layers.
	d. If the layer is a Split Mixed Plane type, you can associate additional nets to the layer.
	e. Click **OK** to close the Plane Layer Nets dialog box.
4. In the Layers Setup dialog box, click a Routing Direction setting. You must assign a primary routing direction to all electrical layers. Nonelectrical layers are not assigned a routing direction. The routing direction affects the manual and autorouting performance. For example, if you select Horizontal but most of the traces on the layer need to be vertical, route editing performance is slow. Also, selecting Any can adversely affect route editing performance.
5. Click **OK**.

## Setting Up a Documentation Layer
SailWind Layout assigns layers 21 to 30 (in default layer mode) as default documentation layers for manufacturing plot types, including two for silkscreen (top and bottom).

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, select a documentation layer. Documentation layers are listed after all electrical layers. A quick way to tell if a layer is a documentation layer is the absence of a letter in the Direction (dir) column.
2. In the Name box, type the name of the layer. By default, SailWind Layout assigns the layer number as its name; for example, Layer\_3. Rename the layer to something that lets you know what the layer is; for example, Gold Mask.
3. Click a Fab. Assembly and Documentation Layer Type setting. If you click SilkScreen, Paste Mask, Solder Mask, or Assembly, this layer is available for association with component layers.
4. Click **OK**.

## Hiding or Displaying Non-electrical Layers in Layer Lists
Default SailWind Layout designs come with many available layers and these layers all appear in the layer list of certain dialogs. If your design only uses a few layers, the result is a large number of unused layers appearing in the layer list. You can hide those unused layers from view to shorten the layer list wherever it displaysâ€”for example, the Layer list of the Standard Toolbar, the Layers Setup and Display Colors dialog boxes.

![](/layout/guide/14/_page_8_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** For instructions on hiding layers in the PCB design, see "Hiding Layers".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You can hide only non-electrical layers from layer lists.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, click **Enable/Disable**.
2. Select the appropriate check box in the Enabled column to either enable or disable a layer.

**Tip**

While the Enabled column is the only editable column, you can sort the displayed layers by any column. Click a column heading to sort by that column's values. Click the same column heading again to re-sort in the reverse order.

3. Click **OK** to return to the Layers Setup dialog box.

## Setting Layer Parameters
Layer parameters are provided to confirm design compliance and calculate impedance. For example, when you verify your design, the electrodynamic check uses such information to confirm design compliance as electrical layer and dielectric material layer thickness and dielectric constant information defined in the Layer Parameter Setup dialog box. Besides, more layer parameters are provided for impedance calculation.

Traces on high-speed printed circuit boards can act like transmission lines that "broadcast" interference to adjacent conductors. With the high-speed rules module, you can use Rules to set clearances on a net class, net, or pin-to-pin connection basis; then use high-speed checking to report on properties such as impedance, delay, track length, daisy chaining, and parallel routing. These issues cause interference and create costly problems in prototyping. You can run checks against the entire board or against specific nets.

**Prerequisites**

You must specify your plane layers in the Layers Setup dialog box before you run an electrodynamic check. For a two-layer board, temporarily identify one of the layers as a plane layer.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, click the **Advanced** button. The Layer Parameter Setup dialog box opens.
2. Set layer parameters as needed.
	- For each dielectric material layer, double-click the Type cell to select whether the "layer" is a Prepreg or Substrate layer.
	- For dielectric material and coating layers, fields Dk and Df are editable. For electrical layers, you can set such parameters as Drum SR, Matte SR, Ref.Plane, SE Width, DIFF Width, and DIFF Spacing.

For detailed parameter description, refer to the table below.

## Unassigning a Netname from a Plane Layer
You can remove a netname from its assignment to a plane layer.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, select a layer defined as a CAM Plane or a Mixed Plane.
2. Click **Assign Nets**. The Plane Layer Nets Dialog Boxopens.
3. Click the netname in the Assigned Nets list.
4. Click **Remove**. The netname is moved back to the All Nets list.
5. Click **OK**.

## Reassigning Electrical Layers
When you alter the number of electrical layers, you must reassign the old layers to locations in the new layer setup.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- When reassigning layers, component keepouts are ignored. They remain on the layer on which you created them.
- You cannot modify the layer definition for electrical layers when a physical design reuse exists on the board.
- If a route is attached to a pad that is not available on the new layer, such as a surface mount pin or a partial via, the program places a zero-length unroute from the end of the trace to the component pin.

**Procedure**

1. In the Layers Setup Dialog Box, click **Reassign**. The Reassign Electrical Layers Dialog Boxopens.
2. Click the number of the layer you want to reassign from the Old list.
3. Type the layer number you want to assign it to in the "New Layer #" box. You cannot merge items from an old to a new layer, but you can swap layers. Additionally, the target layer must be empty.
4. The following information moves from the old layer to the new layer:
	- Traces and vias
	- Drafting objects
	- Layer name, layer type, routing direction, and component/plane layer parameters
5. If you decrease the number of layers and the selected layer has no data, you can remove the layer. To remove it, click **Delete**.
6. Click **OK**. You return to the Layers Setup dialog box.

**Results**

The following layer properties are changed during layer reassignment:

- Name
- Plane status
- Layer (routing) direction
- Dielectric constant and thickness (associated with upper copper layer)
- Associated nonelectrical layers (for top and bottom)
- List of assigned nets
- Colors, including outline colors

![](/layout/guide/14/_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** Because both layer names and colors are reassigned, an object remains in the same color after reassignment.

The following objects have an assigned layer and are reassigned during layer reassignment:

- Traces
2D lines, free and in decal (part outlines)
- Copper, open and closed, free and in decals, but not pin-associated copper
- Keepouts, free and in decals
- Copper cutouts, free, associated, and in decals
- Texts, free, combined with 2D lines, and in decals
- Attribute labels
- Pour outlines and plane areas
- Pour or plane area hatch outlines and hatch voids
- Conditional clearance rules
- Layer mask in routing rules

The following objects have an assigned layer and are not reassigned during layer reassignment:

**Tip** Before deleting an electrical layer, make sure that you first delete all of the following objects from, and any references to, the layer.

- Pad definitions on absolute layers in pad stacks (for decals and vias)
- Pin-associated copper in decals
- Start and end layers for partial vias
- Drill pairs
