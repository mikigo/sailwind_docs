# Chapter 9 Starting a New Design
Typically, you start a new design by creating a new design file, and then importing a netlist created by a schematic tool such as SailWind Logic. But if the design you are planning is simple and does not require a schematic, you can create the design all within SailWind Layout itself. Designs you create in this way are referred to as "layout-driven" designs.

## Creating a New Design File
Use the New command to create a new design file.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open SailWind Layout and click **New**. (If you already have a design open in SailWind Layout, click the **File> New** menu item).
- 2. In the Set Start-up File Dialog Box, select the start-up file. A start-up file contains global settings such as layer definitions, grids, clearance rules, the attribute dictionary, and so on.
- 3. If you want to use this start-up for all new design files, select the Don't Display Again check box.
- 4. Click **OK**.

## Import of a Schematic Design Netlist
The process of laying out a design in SailWind Layout typically begins with importing a netlist file containing all the schematic information for the design, including a list of all the parts and their decals.

During the netlist file import process, all the parts are sourced from the library, and their decals are stacked at the origin, ready for placement.

**CAUTION:**

For a netlist import to succeed, all parts and decals listed in the netlist must exist in your library. If any are missing, the import operation writes an *ascii.err* file listing the missing parts/decals. To import the netlist successfully, you must add these components to your library, either by adding a library which contains the missing components to your library list, or by creating the missing part types and missing decals in an existing library.

The procedure you use to import a netlist depends on which schematic tool you are using. For productspecific instructions, see one of the following topics:

- "Creating a New PCB Design by Manually Importing the SailWind Logic Netlist"on page 271
- Creating a New PCB Design from an OrCAD Netlist

## Cross-Probing
You can cross-probe with SailWind Logic to simplify importing the netlist and placing the parts.

The procedure you use to cross-probeon page 1819 depends on which schematic tool you are using. For product-specific instructions, see Cross-Probe Between SailWind Productsin the *SailWind Logic Guide*.

## Creating a New PCB Design from an OrCAD Netlist
When you lay out a new PCB design, you typically start by importing a netlist created in a schematic capture application. This includes the ability to import a netlist created in ORCAD.

**Procedure**

- 1. Change the filename extension of the OrCAD netlist from *.net* to *.asc*. SailWind Layout only imports netlist files with *.asc* extensions.
- 2. Open the netlist file in a text editor.
- 3. In SailWind Layout, click the **File> Reports** menu item.
- 4. In the Reports Dialog Box, select "PowerPCB V3.0 Format Netlist", and click **OK**.
- 5. In the report that is displayed, copy the header line, which will look something like this:

!PADS-POWERPCB-V3.0-MILS! DESIGN DATABASE ASCII FILE 2.0

6. Paste the header line in the OrCAD netlist, replacing the original header, which will look something like this:

\*PADS-PCB\*

- 7. Replace the software version number (V3.0) in the new header with the number of the software version you are running.
- 8. Save and close the netlist file.
- 9. In SailWind Layout, click the **File> Import** menu item.
- 10. In the File Import dialog box, browse for and select the OrCAD netlist *.asc* file, and then click **Open**.
- 11. If an *ascii.err* file is produced, perform the following steps:
- a. Close the design into which you just imported the netlist. Click **No** when you are prompted to save the design.
- b. Add any missing components listed in the *ascii.err* file to your library, either by adding a library which contains the missing components to your library list, or by creating the missing part types and decals in an existing library. (See "Adding Libraries to the Library List", "Creating and Modifying Part Types", and Creating and Editing PCB Decals" for information on how to do these tasks.)
- c. Resolve any other errors found in the *ascii.err* file. Error messages of the type "\*Bad \*PART\* ascii data line format" may indicate that an invalid character has been found in the part name. The characters invalid in part names are:

. , : ^ [ ] \$ \* { } ( ) @ ? = \ <space>

d. When all the errors have been resolved, repeat this procedure.

**Results**

The import process sources all the part types and decals from the library and stacks the decals at the origin. You can then use the **Tools > Disperse Components** menu item to spread out the components.

## Layout-Driven Designs
Most PCB designs are schematic-driven, meaning designers create them in schematic software and the components, connections, and constraints then pass to SailWind Layout. After they are in SailWind Layout, according to those constraints, layout designers place components, making their connections permanent with copper traces.

But if the design is simple, and you are able to skip creating the schematic(s), you can add components, create connections, and create constraints from the ECO toolbar in SailWind Layout. The ECO toolbar contains all the tools that are design-altering.

If your design is schematic-driven, it must remain synchronized/in parallel between the schematic and layout tool. You can record design modifications made by tools on the ECO toolbar in an ECO file that you can use to synchronize the schematic design with the layout design.

But if you create a layout-driven design, and you have no schematic to synchronize with, there is no need to maintain a *.eco* file. When you open the ECO Toolbar and are prompted with the ECO Options dialog box, you can safely clear the "Write ECO file" check box and then ignore all the settings of the ECO Options dialog box.

Using the tools on the ECO Toolbar, you can:

- Add and delete components
- Add and name connections/nets
- Rename and delete nets
- Rename component reference designators
- Change components
- Swap pins and gates
- Assign constraints/design rules
