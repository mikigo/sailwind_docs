## Physical Design Reuse
The most common use of the reuse feature is to clone the placement and layout of multi-channel design elements. To describe the feature more generally, if you have portions of your design that have a strict relationship with each other, you can group those elements of your design to lock them together to reuse them, or to clone them. The physical design reuse includes properties and attributes of these objects, such as test point status. You can create a reuse of any design elements except for the board outline and board cutouts.

Reuse a circuit in other designs to effectively reuse proven and tested elements and shorten the design cycle of new designs.

A design may have a common circuit that you want to repeat a number of times in the same design. Place the components and interconnect traces for the common circuit, save that as a physical design reuse, and then clone it using other existing design elements.

Each time you create a physical design reuse, it is assigned a reuse type, a unique name that describes it. The reuse type is similar to the library part type. Each physical design reuse also has an origin. The origin is visible only when you reset the origin of the reuse. You cannot display the reuse name and reuse type in the design.

Here are the three ways a reuse can be used:

- Like a unionon page 504, the elements of a reuse are glued together and are moved as a group. For example, if you have not finalized placement, but want to start routing, you could route associated elements and then move them later if needed.
- Save the reuse to a file, and in any design, use the reuse as a template to create a clone of the layout using existing design elements. For example, if you have a redundant or multi-channel area in your design, you could place and route the interconnects of one channel, and then use it as a template to automatically place and route the other identical channels. This accelerates placement and routing of the design.
- Save the reuse to a file, and in ECO mode, add the reuse elements to your design. For example, if you have no schematic to supply the parts and netlist, you can add the reuse into the design.

## Elements in a Physical Design Reuse
You can include certain elements in a physical design reuse. The physical design reuse includes properties and attributes of these elements, such as test point status. Each element is assigned a unique ID in the reuse. You must completely select an item to include it in a reuse. SailWind Layout does not include partially selected items in a reuse.

Physical design reuse elements include:

- Component Elements
- Routing Objects
- Drafting Objects
- Unions and Arrays
- Net-Based Design Rules

The physical design reuse opens as a new design. The start-up file information and design rules saved with the physical design reuse load as well. When you load a physical design reuse, single pin components are added to the ends of the single pin nets to preserve the net objects. These components have no drill size, pad size, outline, and so on. They are glued by default, non-ECO registered, and located at the 0,0 origin. The component name includes the entire netname, or reasonable portions of it, to easily identify the component to net associations.

**Component Elements**

The table below shows component elements eligible for inclusion in a physical design reuse.

| Eligible Element     | Description                                                                  |

**Table 107. Component Elements Used in Physical Design Reuse(continued)**

**Routing Objects**

The path of route segments, or the route pattern, is stored with width, layer, and netname information. For a physical design reuse, it is assumed that a net consists of one or more pin pairs. Nets are not included directly in a reuse. Instead, the physical properties of the net such as traces, vias, jumpers, coppers, and signal names are included, so the net is preserved.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_2_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip**

Because only net properties are included in a physical design reuse, unrouted pin pairs are not included. The signal name of a pin pair, however, is included and is assigned to pins of the pin pair.

The table below shows route elements you can include in a physical design reuse.

| Route Element                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Partial Routes                     | Incomplete, but contiguous, route segments of a pin pair that start<br>or terminate on one component pin. The unrouted segments are<br>also saved in the physical design reuse.                                                                                                               |
| Floating Segments                  | Segments of a pin pair that neither start nor end on a component<br>pin. The path of the segments is stored in the physical design<br>reuse with width, layer, and netname attributes. This may require<br>generating new pin pairs when the physical design reuse is added<br>to the design. |
| Multiple Pins of a Net             | Complete or partial route of the same net, with more than<br>one component pin of the net included in the selection. When<br>included in the physical design reuse, pin pairs may be created                                                                                                  |

**Table 109. Line Elements Used in Physical Design Reuse(continued)**

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

Board outlines, board cutouts, hatch outlines, hatch voids, via thermals, and pad thermals are not included in the physical design reuse.

**Unions and Arrays**

Any completely selected union or component array is stored in a physical design reuse. Clusters are not included in a physical design reuse.

**Net-Based Design Rules**

Design rules for nets and net classes, default rules, and net-based pin pair and group rules are included in the physical design reuse. No other design rules, including pin pair-based rules, are included. Design rules are not added to a design from the reuse, but are used for comparison purposes.

## Process of an Added Physical Design Reuse
When you add a physical design reuse to a design, SailWind Layout compares the design and the physical design reuse and records the results in the report file.

Information is processed in the following order:

- Layer Definitions Compared
- Part Types Compared
- PCB Decals Compared
- Components Added
- Pin Pairs Added
- Routes and Design Rules Added
- Polygon and Text Items Added

When you add a second instance of a physical design reuse to the same design, the checking that occurs (described below) is skipped. However, if you copy a physical design reuse and paste it into a different design, the checking is performed.

A report file is created logging any errors or warnings. The report file is named *Layout.err* and located in *..\SailWind Projects*. If an error is encountered, the add reuse process cancels. If you receive warnings, you can choose whether to cancel the process or add the reuse.

**Layer Definitions Compared**

The layer arrangements in both the physical design reuse and the design are compared. If both are identical, the physical design reuse is added.

Errors include:

- Layer counts not matching.
- Layer types not matching. Documentation layer type differences are not treated as errors. The layer type in the reuse is ignored in this case.

Warnings include:

- Layer names not matching. The layer name in the reuse is ignored. The report file details the layer name change.
- Other Layer Definition Data. Layer thickness, layer associations, and so on, are stored in the reuse, but the design settings are always used. This includes netnames associated with plane layers.

**Part Types Compared**

The part type names in the physical design reuse and the design are compared. If both are the same, the two part type definitions are compared. The definitions must match exactly, or the process cancels. Any differences found are recorded as errors in the report file for each part type.

**PCB Decals Compared**

If the PCB decals share the same name in the physical design reuse and in the design, the two decal definitions are compared. The definitions must match, or the add reuse process cancels. Slight differences in the decal definitions are tolerated. The location and orientation of the reference designator, part type, and attribute labels do not have to be identical. The attribute name and value, however, must match. Also, if the decal definitions differ, but the pin counts match, the decal definition in the physical design reuse is added to the design with a new name (its original name with an "A" suffix).

When the reuse is added, the PCB decal definition in the design is used.

When the decal pin counts do not match, errors are recorded in the report file. When PCB decals are renamed, warnings are recorded in the report file.

**Components Added**

After the Reuse Properties dialog box settings are accounted for, component elements are added. If a part cannot be added, the add reuse process cancels.

Warnings include:

- Start at, Increment by, or Suffix/Prefix assigns a used reference designator. If a current setting in the Reuse Properties Dialog Boxcreates a reference designator conflict, a message immediately appears and you can return to the Reuse Properties dialog box to choose different settings.
- Start at or Increment by assigns a new reference designator. If a reference designator is renamed (for example with a prefix), a message is recorded in the report file.
- Same or Next Highest assigns a new reference designator. If a reference designator is renamed, a message is recorded in the report file.
- Assign Prefix assigns a new reference designator. If a reference designator is renamed, a message is recorded in the report file.
- Assign Suffix assigns a new reference designator. If a reference designator is renamed, a message is recorded in the report file.

**Pin Pairs Added**

Pin pairs are added to the design. Pin pairs are also added to the design to merge reuse nets with existing nets in the design. If all pin pairs can be added to the design without conflict, the Add Reuse process continues. If a pin pair cannot be added, the Add Reuse process continues but the net is not added to the design.

When a net is renamed, a message is recorded in the report file.

**Routes and Design Rules Added**

Route elements are added based on the same rules and checking procedures for the route copy command. If any portion of the route patterns in the physical design reuse cannot be added to the design, the Add Reuse process continues and a message is recorded in the report file.

Nets added to the design assume the design rules for the net with which they merge. Otherwise, nets assume the default net rules. Rules saved with the physical design reuse are not used.

Jumpers are added to the design similarly to components and vias. The pad stacks and components are added as defined in the reuse definition, including any settings for thermal status, test point status, and so on.

Warnings include:

- Single pin nets not added without an existing net. Single pin nets are only added to the design when a net of the same name already exists in the design. Otherwise, single pin nets are not added. If single pin nets are removed, a warning is recorded in the report file.
- Via definitions not matching. If via definitions are the same in the physical design reuse and the design, the two via definitions are compared. The definitions must match or the via is added to the design with a new name (its original name with an "A" suffix). When the reuse is added, the

via definition in the design is used. If a new via definition is created, a message is recorded in the report file.

- Add route fails. If any portion of the route cannot be added, a message is recorded in the report file describing the failure.
- Add jumper fails. If a jumper cannot be added, a message is recorded in the report file describing the failure.

**Polygon and Text Items Added**

Polygon and text items are added to the design. There are no restrictions on adding polygons to a design, since adding a reuse must be performed with DRC off.

**Tip** Pour cutouts are saved in the physical design reuse; however, board cutouts are not.

## Creating a Physical Design Reuse
Select design items and add them to a reuse.

**Procedure**

1. Select the objects you want to include in the physical design reuse. You must select the entire object - partial selections are not included.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_7_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** Copper planes must be in Pour Outline mode to be included in the Reuse. The copper plane cannot be flooded or in Hatch Outline mode when the Reuse is created.

2. Right-click and click the **Make Reuse** popup menu item. Ineligible items are removed from the selection. Among them, selected tacks and trace corners are replaced with appropriate trace segments. Selected pin pairs are replaced with trace segments, vias, and jumpers (if pin pair is fully or partially routed). Unrouted pin pairs are removed from the selection.

**Tip**

If one of the items you selected is not a valid physical design reuse element, the message "Selection does not include items valid for inclusion into a reuse. Retry your selection." appears. Click **Report** to open a deselection report, in the default text editor, that lists items not valid for inclusion in a reuse. When you close the report, you return to the error message. Click **OK** and repeat Step 1.

- 3. In the Make Reuse Dialog Box, in the Reuse Type box, type a description for the reuse.
- 4. Optionally, in the Reuse Name box, type a different reuse name if the default name based on the Reuse Type is not acceptable.
- 5. If you want to save the reuse to a file to use it as a template for cloning or to use it in other designs, select the Save to File check box.
- 6. Optionally, click to view the Selection Report or Deselection Report, to ensure that all expected elements are in the reuse. The report file *report.rep* is created in the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version> \Settings* folder and opens in the default text editor. The deselection report and the selection report are created using the same file name. If you want to save this file, do so in the default text editor using a different file name.
- 7. Click **OK**.
	- If the reuse type is already assigned to another physical design reuse in the design, the message "A reuse type in the design already exists with the name XXX. Reuse type names cannot be duplicated in the design" appears. Click **OK** and specify another reuse type.
	- If the reuse name is already assigned to another physical design reuse in the design, the message "Reuse name <name> already exists. Reuse names cannot be duplicated in the design" appears. Click **OK** and specify another reuse name.
- 8. If you selected the Save to File check box, the Reuse Save As dialog box appears.
	- a. Type a physical design reuse file name and specify a location in which to save the file. The default physical design reuse file name is the reuse type name with a *.reu* file extension. The default folder is *\SailWind Projects\Reuse*.
	- b. Click **Save**. If you specified a reuse file name that is different from the reuse name used in the design, the message "Do you want to change reuse type name to XXX?" appears.
	- c. Click **Yes** to change the reuse type in the design to match the file name you specified, click **No**  to ignore the change, or click **Cancel** to cancel the Save to File process.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_8_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** Alternatively, to select physical design reuse blocks you can set the Selection Filteron page 114 to Reuse or the Find Dialog Boxto Reuse type.

Now you can:

- Modify the properties of the reuseon page 609
- Move the reuseon page 602
- Rotate the reuse
- Create clones of the reuseon page 603
- Break the reuseon page 610
- Set the origin of the reuseon page 610
- Save it to a fileon page 602 for use in other designs or to add a reuse to the design in ECO mode
- Report on the contents of the reuseon page 611

## Moving a Reuse
When you move a physical design reuse, traces routed to elements outside the reuse stretch, similarly to moving a group.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the DRO modeless commandon page 83 and press the Enter key to turn off Design Rule Checking. DRC must be off to move a reuse.
- 2. Select the physical design reuse.on page 601
- 3. Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
- 4. Click to indicate a new location for the physical design reuse. You can right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item to cancel the move.

## Saving a Reuse
You can save a physical design reuse to a file at any time. The saved version of the physical design reuse becomes known as the *reuse definition*.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a reuseon page 601.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Save to File** popup menu item.
- 3. Optionally, you can type a new name for the reuse type from what it was named within the design.
- 4. Browse for a location in which to save the selected physical design reuse. The default file name is the reuse type name with a *.reu* file extension. The default folder is *\SailWind Projects\Reuse*.
- 5. Click **Save**.
	- If you changed the reuse file name, the message "Do you want to change reuse type name to XXX?" appears. Click **Yes** to change the reuse type file name, click **No** to ignore the change, or click **Cancel** to abort the Save to File process.
	- If the name in the Reuse Type box is already assigned to another physical design reuse in the reuse folder, the message "XXX.reu already exists. Do you want to replace it?" appears. Click **Yes** to overwrite the reuse file or click **No** to specify another type.

Now you can:

- Use the reuse as a template to create clones in another design.on page 603
- Add the reuse to any design in ECO mode.on page 606

## Design Elements Made Like a Reuse Definition
The Make Like Reuse command uses existing design components with their logical interconnects to create a clone of a reuse definition. SailWind Layout automatically creates all other physical design reuse elements not yet present in the design—for example, traces, vias, coppers, 2D lines, and text.

The Make Like Reuse process maps components and interconnects of the physical design reuse circuit and searches for a match among the subcircuits within the design. Components are filtered based on the part type, the number of connections, the decal type, and the value/tolerance attributes. Nets are filtered based on the number of connections. Successive passes filter components and nets based on neighboring net and neighboring component characteristics, including terminal types and connection count. Parallel circuits are handled, and the filtering is independent of reference designators and netnames.

Default reuse properties are assigned to the new physical design reuse, including the reuse name. The Designator enumeration and Net Preferences are ignored since the elements already exist in the design.

Make Like Reuse skips glued components, components that are union or cluster members, component elements in another physical design reuse, and components with attached traces.

You can add a physical design reuse in either of these ways:

- Using Make Like Reuse in Object Mode Use this method to allow the software to find any compatible elements to use in the reuse clone.
- Using Make Like Reuse in Verb Mode Use this method to specify which design elements are used in each reuse clone. By choosing the components based on their schematic relationship, you can maintain the expected placement of the components.

## Using Make Like Reuse in Object Mode
Select a reuse within the design and create a clone of it using design elements that the software selects.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a physical design reuse if the design is in default layer mode and the reuse to add is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the modeless command DRO and press the Enter key to turn off Design Rule Checking. You must turn DRC off to make a like reuse. If DRC is not turned off, a prompt appears that allows you to turn DRC off.
- 2. Select an existing physical design reuse in the design as described in "Selecting a Reuse in the Design."
- 3. To use the Reference Designator positions and style of the reuse, click the **Tools > Options** menu item and then click the **Design** category, and select the Apply reuse Ref Des placement check box.
- 4. In the Matching Result Dialog Box, see whether a match to the selected reuse is found.
	- If yes, each part has an equivalent one in the Equivalent Ref. Des. list, and the new physical design reuse dynamically attaches to the pointer after clicking **OK**.
	- If not, some parts have no match. In this case, you can clear the Value check box to have another try.

For more parameter description, see Table 189.

5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. If a match is found in Step 4, with the like reuse on the pointer, click to place it.

**Results**

If you have bridge copper in your reuse block, you should ensure that it has retained its bridge status and assigned nets.

## Using Make Like Reuse in Verb Mode
Unlike other buttons, the Make Like Reuse button is not "sticky" in verb mode, but instead it allows you to pre-select the components to use in the reuse before applying the Make Like Reuse command.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a physical design reuse if the design is in default layer mode and the reuse to add is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the modeless command DRO and press the Enter key to turn off Design Rule Checking. You must turn DRC off to make a like reuse. If DRC is not turned off, a prompt appears that allows you to turn DRC off.
- 2. Optionally, select the group of components you want to include in the new reuse.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Tip** If you do not select a specific group of components to use in the reuse, any available components that match the reuse are used. This can group components that are not grouped together in the schematic. Skip this step if it does not concern you.

- If you want to pre-select a particular group of components to use in the reuse, you must save  your reuse definitionbefore making a like reuse.
- Use cross-probing with the schematic software to select components that are grouped in the schematic.
- The group of components you select can be larger than required for the reuse; any useless components are ignored. You cannot select both the reuse and the group of components.
- 3. To use the Reference Designator positions and style of the reuse, click the **Tools > Options** menu item and then click the **Design** category, and select the Apply reuse Ref Des placement check box.
- 4. Click the **Design Toolbar** button and then click the **Make Like Reuse** button on the Design Toolbar. The Open Reuse File dialog box appears.
- 5. Select a reuse in the Select Reuse Module Dialog Box.
- 6. In the Matching Result Dialog Box, see whether a match to the selected reuse is found.
	- If yes, each part has an equivalent one in the Equivalent Ref. Des. list, and the new physical design reuse dynamically attaches to the pointer after clicking **OK**.
	- If not, some parts have no match. In this case, you can clear the Value check box to have another try.

For more parameter description, see Table 189.

7. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. If a match is found in Step 6, with the like reuse on the pointer, click to place it.

**Results**

If you have bridge copper in your reuse block, you should ensure that it has retained its bridge status and assigned nets.

## Reuse Blocks Added in ECO Mode
You can add reuse blocks to your design. Since adding reuse blocks will add new netlist elements, it must be done in ECO mode.

When the elements already exist in the schematic, use the Make Like Reuse commandinstead.

The methods, to adding a reuse in ECO mode, are different depending if it is the first instance of the reuse or if you are adding an existing reuse.

Adding the First Instance of Design Reuse Adding an Existing Reuse

### Adding the First Instance of Design Reuse
After you create a physical design reuse and save it to a reuse definition file, you can add the elements of the reuse as new design elements in ECO mode.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a reuse to a design if the design is in default layer mode and the reuse to add is in increased layer mode. Use the Layers Setup Dialog Boxto change the design to increased layer mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **ECO Toolbar** button. To add or copy a reuse, you must be in ECO mode; therefore, all components, pin pairs, and nets added to the design can be recorded in the *.eco* file using standard ECO commands.
- 2. Type the DRO modeless command on page 83and press the Enter key to turn off Design Rules Checking. You must turn DRC off to add or copy a reuse. If DRC is not turned off, a prompt appears that allows you to turn DRC off.
- 3. Click the **Add Reuse** button on the ECO Toolbar. The Add Reuse dialog box appears.
- 4. Select the reuse file to add and click **Open**. The Reuse Properties Dialog Boxappears.

If the reuse file you select to add already exists in the design, the message "Reuse type XXX already exists in the design. OK to make a copy of this reuse type?" appears. Click **OK** to add a copy of the selected physical design reuse from the design or click **Cancel**.

- 5. Set the reuse name and (Reference) Designator Preferences.
- 6. Click **Net Properties**. The Net Properties dialog boxon page 1491 appears.
- 7. Resolve net conflicts, if any, and click **OK**.
- 8. In the Reuse Properties dialog box, click **OK**. The reuse file is compared against the current design to detect possible reference designator, layer, decal, and netname conflicts, and to detect other errors and warnings.

For more information, see "Process of an Added Physical Design Reuse".

The results of this comparison are recorded in the *Layout.err* report file in the *C:\<install\_folder> \<version>\Programs* folder.

- If errors are found, the message "Adding this reuse to the design resulted in xxx errors and xxx warnings. The Add Reuse command was aborted. Show report file?" appears. Click **Yes** to view the report file in the default text editor; otherwise click **No** and return to step 3.
- If errors are not found, but warnings are, the message "Adding this reuse to the design resulted in 0 errors and xxx warnings. Show report file?" appears. Click **Yes** to view the report file in the default text editor; otherwise click **No** and proceed.
- If no errors or warnings are found, the message "Reuse added without warnings or errors. Show report file?" appears. Click **Yes** to view the report file in the default text editor; otherwise click **No** and proceed.
- 9. When all physical design reuse elements are successfully added to the design, the physical design reuse dynamically attaches to the pointer. With the Reuse on the pointer, click to place it.

If you have bridge copper in your reuse block, you should ensure that it has retained its bridge status and assigned nets.

Process of an Added Physical Design Reuse

### Adding an Existing Reuse
Add a copy of an existing physical design reuse to your design in any of three ways.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **ECO Toolbar** button. To add or copy a reuse, you must be in ECO mode; therefore, all components, pin pairs, and nets added to the design can be recorded in the *.eco* file using standard ECO commands.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** You can copy and paste a reuse outside of ECO mode if the reuse contains only drafting items and no netlist items.

- 2. Type the DRO modeless command on page 83and press the Enter key to turn off Design Rules Checking. You must turn DRC off to add or copy a reuse. If DRC is not turned off, a prompt appears that allows you to turn DRC off.
- 3. Select the reuse using one of the following methods:
- **Copy and Paste**  select the reuse in the design:
	- i. Select an existing physical design reuse in the design as described in "Selecting a Reuse in the Design". You can only copy one reuse at a time.
	- ii. Click the **Edit> Copy** menu item.
	- iii. Click the **Edit> Paste** menu item.
- **Add Reuse button in Object mode**  select the reuse in the design:
	- i. Select an existing physical design reuse in the design as described in "Selecting a Reuse in the Design".
	- ii. Click the **Add Reuse** button on the ECO Toolbar.
- **Add Reuse button in Verb mode** select the reuse definition file:
	- i. Click the **Add Reuse** button from the ECO Toolbar. The Add Reuse dialog box appears.
	- ii. Click the reuse file you want to add and click **Open**. Since the reuse type already exists in the current design, the message "Reuse Type XXX already exists in the design. OK to make a copy of this reuse type?" appears.
	- iii. Click **OK**.
- 4. In the Reuse Properties Dialog Boxthat appears, modify the physical design reuse properties as needed.
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. With the Reuse on the pointer, click to place it.

If you have bridge copper in your reuse block, you should ensure that it has retained its bridge status and assigned nets.

When you copy a physical design reuse and paste it into a different design, the reuse file is compared against the current design to detect possible reference designator, layer, decal, and netname conflicts.

Process of an Added Physical Design Reuse

## Editing a Physical Design Reuse Definition
You can edit a reuse definition and update the reuse file (*.reu*), modifying it like a PCB design.

The reuse definitionon page 1854 is the master copy of the physical design reuse that saves to a file. The saved version of the physical design reuse is the version you should use in other designs. All resulting instances of the physical design reuse are based on this file.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the physical design reuse file:
	- a. Click the **File> Open** menu item.
	- b. Click SailWind Layout Reuse Files (\*.reu) as the file type.
	- c. Navigate to the appropriate folder and click the reuse file to open.
	- d. Click **Open**. The reuse is selected after you open it.
- 2. Select the physical design reuse.on page 601
- 3. Right-click and click the **Break Reuse** popup menu item to break the reuseon page 610.
- 4. Edit the reuse, as necessary.
	- Change the layer stackupon page 315.
	- Change the design ruleson page 412.
	- Modify the reuse elements.
- 5. When finished changes to the reuse, recreate the physical design reuse:
	- a. Select all of the reuse elements.
	- b. Right-click and click the **Make Reuse** popup menu item. The Make Reuse Dialog Boxappears.
	- c. Select the Save to File check box.
	- d. Type the Reuse Type and Reuse Name or if you do not remember it, you can type any name and select the correct file name in the next step.
	- e. In the Reuse Save As dialog box, click the name of the reuse file you just modified and click **Save**. The message "xxx.reu already exists. Do you want to replace it?" appears.
	- f. Click **Yes** to overwrite the existing file. The physical design reuse definition is updated.

## Modifying Reuse Properties in the Design
You can modify a physical design reuse, but you cannot modify the elements within the physical design reuse.

More modification options are available to you in ECO mode. When in ECO mode, any component or netnames you modify in the Reuse Properties Dialog Boxrecord in the *.eco* file using standard ECO commands.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a physical design reuse.on page 601
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. Modify the location, rotation, glued status, and reuse name, if necessary.
- 4. In ECO modeon page 1824, you can modify the reference designator preferences or net properties, if necessary.
- 5. Click **OK**.

**Results**

If you changed the reference designator preferences or net properties, the component elements and private nets are renamed.

## Resetting the Origin of a Reuse
Every physical design reuse has an origin. The default origin is the component pin with the lowest X and Y values. The origin marker is square, rather than round, to differentiate it from the design and component origin markers. The physical design reuse origin marker is visible only when you reset the origin.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a physical design reuseon page 601 whose origin you want to reset.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Reset Origin** popup menu item. The reuse origin marker appears.
- 3. Click to indicate the new position of the origin. A message appears indicating the coordinates of the new origin and asks if you want to use this as the origin.
- <span id="page-17-1"></span>4. Click **Yes** to use the new origin. Click **No** to choose another origin.

## Breaking a Reuse
You must break a physical design reuse before you can edit the elements within it. The Break Reuse command disassembles the physical design reuse and returns its elements to normal design data. When you break a physical design reuse, elements return to their pre-reuse state; SailWind Layout maintains route protection and other settings. You do not need to be in ECO mode to break a physical design reuse.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a physical design reuseon page 601
- 2. Right-click and click the **Break Reuse** popup menu item. The message "OK to Break Reuse(s)?" appears.
- 3. Click **Yes** to break the physical design reuse.

![](/layout/guide/26/_page_17_Picture_22.jpeg)

**Note:** Reuses are automatically broken when you import an .*eco* file.

## Deleting a Reuse
You can delete a reuse in ECO mode. Doing so removes all components and nets in the reuse.

If you want to simply break the reuse, see "Breaking a Reuse".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot delete physical design reuses that contain glued components or protected routes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **ECO Toolbar** button. To delete a reuse, you must be in ECO mode; therefore, all components, pin pairs, and nets deleted from the design can be recorded in the *.eco* file using standard ECO commands.
- 2. Select the physical design reuseon page 601 you want to delete.
- 3. Click the **Edit> Delete** menu item, or press the Delete key.
- 4. In the confirmation message that appears, clear the Delete Routes check box if you want to preserve routes connected to the physical design reuse. It is not always possible to maintain traces connected to physical design reuse components. Delete Routes is selected by default, meaning routes are deleted with the physical design reuse.
- 5. Click **OK** to delete the physical design reuse.

## Creating a Reuse Report
You can create a report that contains the name, type, and elements of the selected physical design reuse.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the physical design reuseon page 601.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Report Contents** popup menu item.

**Results**

The report is written to *C:\SailWind Projects\rules.rep* and is displayed by the default text editor.
