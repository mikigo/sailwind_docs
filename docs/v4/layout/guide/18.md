## Attributes
You can use *attributes* to associate information with an object in the design. Attributes are made of two parts: an attribute name and its corresponding value.

For example, you can create an IsSMD attribute to keep track of which parts are SMD and which are not.

You can assign attributes to the following objects:

- PCB (the board)
- Part Type
- Decal
- Part (component; instance of a part in the design)
- Net Class
- Net
- Pin, including jumper pin
- Via

Every attribute you add to a design is added to the Attribute Dictionary. Attributes are assigned for the entire design. Once you name an attribute and set its properties, that name and those properties apply throughout the design.

## Attributes Workflow
Create and manage attributes using a structured workflow.

This is the general process for adding attributes to a design:

- 1. Create attributes. You can create attributes using the Attribute Dictionary. You can also create attributes and assign them to objects using the Object Attributes Dialog Box; however, you cannot modify the properties of the attribute with this dialog box. Therefore, it is easier to create all your attributes in the Attribute Dictionary. Define the attribute properties. You must set the kind of value the attribute should have, the design objects to which you want to assign the attribute, and the hierarchy for the attribute. For more information, see the Creating Attributes for the Designtopic.
- 2. Assign attributes to objects in the design. For more information, see the Design Object Attributes topic.
- 3. You can assign attributes to multiple objects of multiple types. For more information, see the Attribute Manageron page 392 topic.
- 4. When it is necessary to change the attributes assigned to objects use the Properties dialog boxes.

## Attribute Hierarchy
The attribute hierarchy is the search order in which SailWind Layout searches the database to find an attribute value. You can assign attributes using the default hierarchy or you can change the hierarchy, creating your own search order. The lowest level to which you can assign an attribute is the PCB. An attribute applied to the PCB applies to every object on the board, unless you set an attribute at a higher hierarchy level. When you set an attribute at a higher level in the hierarchy, it overrides the PCB level.

The levels in the attribute hierarchy are object dependent, that is, each object has a different hierarchy. You can modify the hierarchy for every attribute using the Objects tabon page 1111 on the Attribute Properties dialog box. The following table shows the attribute default hierarchy for each object type.

| For Object       | Default Hierarchy is                                                                                                                 |  |  |  |

| Net              | Net, Net Class, PCB                                                                                                                  |  |  |  |
| Via              | Via, Net, Net Class, PCB                                                                                                             |  |  |  |

|  |  | Table 75. Attribute Hierarchy(continued) |

| For Object | Default Hierarchy is                             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pin        | Pin, Net, Net Class, Part, Decal, Part Type, PCB |

If you assign attributes to multiple levels and then delete an attribute, the attribute from the next level in the hierarchy is assumed. For example, if you assign an attribute at the Part Type level and at the PCB level, and you delete the attribute at the Part Type level, the attribute at the PCB level is then applied to the component.

## Passing Attributes
You can pass attributes between SailWind Layout and other programs. SailWind Layout provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) acceptable for input and for output among programs.

For more information, see Default Units.

| Program        | Attribute Passing                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| SailWind Logic | You can pass the Value and Tolerance part type attributes in SailWind<br>Logic forward to SailWind Layout as part of a netlist. SailWind Layout<br>can accept the attributes from the netlist.                                    |  |
| IDF            | The default attribute Geometry.Height is automatically exported<br>to IDF. This attribute replaces the ZHEIGHT functionality used in<br>previous versions of SailWind Layout.<br>For more information, see "Exporting IDF Files". |  |
| BoardSim       | You can pass the default attributes Value, Tolerance, Voltage, and<br>PowerGround to BoardSim.                                                                                                                                    |  |
|                | For more information, see "Creating PADS HyperLynx BoardSim -<br>HYP Fileson page<br>".                                                                                                                                           |  |

**Table 76. Passing Attributes to Other Programs**

## Attribute Dictionary
Although you can add new attributes to design objects using the Object Attributes dialog box (select an object > right-click > **Attribute** popup menu item), you must use the Attribute Dictionary to set the properties for attribute values.

It is recommended that you use the Attribute Dictionary to create new attributes for, or to edit and delete attributes in, your design. You can also use the Attribute Dictionary to assign attributes for the design, or remove attributes from objects.

Use the Attribute Dictionary to create attributes in a design. SailWind Layout provides default attributes that are applied to every new design. Although the attributes are provided, they are not assigned to any objects.

You can automatically load attributes for part types and decals from the current libraries into PCB designs using the Attribute Dictionary dialog box. You can load attributes when you open files or you can load the attributes after you open a file. When you load attributes, the following actions occur:

- The Attribute Dictionary is updated with new attributes
- Each new attribute uses the default hierarchy
- Attributes are added to the current part types and decals, as appropriate, in the open design
- ECO registration is turned on for all new attributes
- ECO commands are not stored in the ECO journal file for these updates

For more information, see the "Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box" topic.

Default and Other Attribute Properties and Usage Modifying the Default Attribute Dictionary Assignment of Attributes Attribute Values Attribute Types

### Default and Other Attribute Properties and Usage
SailWind Layout provides default attributes that are available to every design. You can change the default attribute dictionary to match library attributes or to suit other design needs.

For more information, see the "Modifying Design Attribute Properties"on page 389 and "Modifying the  Default Attribute Dictionary"on page 371 topics.

SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see Default Units.

### Modifying the Default Attribute Dictionary
You can edit the default attribute dictionary. You may want to change the default dictionary so it matches your library attributes.

The list of default attributes is stored in two ASCII files, both stored in the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version> \Settings* folder.

- **Default.asc**  Used for new designs.
- **DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc** Used for older (pre-version 3.0) designs. If this file is not found, an attribute dictionary is not loaded with older designs.

The appropriate ASCII file automatically imports when you create a new file or import an older file. For more information, see "File Open Conversions" and "Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box".

**Prerequisites**

Back up your Default.asc or DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc before you overwrite it.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> New** menu item.
- 2. If you want to edit the default attributes to use with older files, click the **File> Import** menu item and import the file *DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc*.
- 3. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 4. Modify the existing attributes or add attributes as needed. For more information, see "Modifying  Design Attribute Properties".
- 5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
- 6. To overwrite the existing file, click the **File> Export** menu item. Do this to change the *default.asc*  or the *DefaultAttributeDictionary.asc* files. If you want to create a new start-up file to use with only new files, go to Step 10.
- 7. Click **ASCII** as the file type and click **Save**. The ASCII Output dialog box appears.
- 8. In the Sections list, select the Attributes check box.
- 9. Click **OK**. The default attribute dictionary is replaced.
- 10. To create a new start-up file, follow the steps described in Creating Start-up Files. Make sure you select the Attributes check box in the Start-up File Output dialog box. A new start-up file is created. You can use this start-up file with all new designs.

### Assignment of Attributes
If you cannot select the object to which you want to assign an attribute, select the related object.

The following table defines the relationship of the objects. For more information, see "Applying an Attribute Value to All Other Objects" on page 395 for assigning to the same object types and Attribute  Manageron page 392 topics to assign to multiple object types.

| Object    | What to Select     |
|-----------|--------------------|
| PCB       | Any object         |
| Part Type | A design component |

**Table 82. Assignment of Attributes**

| Object    | What to Select                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Decal     | A design component                  |
| Part      | A design component                  |
| Jumper    | A Jumper                            |
| Pin       | A Pin                               |
| Net Class | A net that is a member of the class |
| Net       | A Net                               |
| Via       | A Via                               |

**Table 82. Assignment of Attributes(continued)**

### Attribute Values
Attribute values can be 2047 characters long. You can use any printable character, including spaces, in an attribute value. You cannot, however, use a space as the first or last character in the value.

When you enter an attribute value, the exact value you type (in dialog boxes, ASCII files, or the library) is stored. This means that capitalization, leading and trailing zeros, embedded spaces, specific unit prefixes, and the presentation of the Yes/No value are all stored exactly as you type them. Leading and trailing spaces are not saved. Invalid values are not saved.

Exact values are saved for the following attribute types:

- Number
- Decimal umber
- Yes/No
- Measure

Exact values are not saved in the Attribute Dictionary entry for the List attribute type or when you set Limits for Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types. For the Number attribute type, leading zeros are removed. For Decimal Number and Measure attribute types, leading zeros are removed, trailing zeros after the decimal point are removed, and numbers greater than 14 characters are rounded. Numbers with more than 14 zeros may be converted to scientific notation.

When using attribute values:

- Automation does not pass the exact attribute value for Yes/No, Number, or Decimal Number attribute types. Automation does, however, pass the exact attribute value for the Measure attribute type.
- Automation ignores whether an attribute is read only, system, or hidden. Therefore, Automation can change all attributes (properties, Attribute Dictionary entry, and value), regardless of their state.

#### Special Attribute Measurements
You can enter complex units like ounces/sq. foot for copper thickness; however, SailWind Layout does not input, process, or output prefixes for complex units.

• Size/Dimension. SailWind Layout accepts as input, processes, and outputs Size/Dimension units using the values shown in the table below.

| Unit set on Global Tab<br>(Options) | Output Example | Comment             |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Mils                                | 12 mil         | 1 mil = 25.4*10-6 m |
| Metric                              | 3 mm           | 1 mm = 1*10-3 m     |
| Inches                              | 2"             | 1" = 25.4*10-3 m    |

**Table 83. Size and Dimension Measurements**

• Percentages. SailWind Layout accepts as input, processes, and outputs a percentage, like 10%, if you use the percent symbol (%).

#### Number/Decimal Number Attribute Values and ECO
SailWind Layout automatically converts attribute values for the Number, Decimal Number, or Measure type properties during the ECO process.

For example, a frequency value, if entered as 100 at the schematic or library, is converted to .1 kHz by default. Also, leading and trailing zeroes are truncated. For example, the decimal number 123.400 becomes 123.4.

Although these conversions are correct, Compare Netlist and the ECO process, detect and report these conversions as differences. Therefore, a design populated with attributes could have thousands of warnings. To avoid this, do one of the following:

- Define attributes as Free Text type in the Attribute Dictionary. When you want to take advantage of the math functions in the Attribute Manager dialog box, go to the Attribute Dictionary and change the type to Number, Decimal Number, or Measure. Then, before performing a comparison or beginning an ECO, set the type back to Free Text.
- Use the Number, Decimal Number, or Measure types. Make sure the attributes are ECOregistered and then perform a backward annotation. The values are converted in the design and backward annotated to the schematic. The schematic and PCB layout will now be synchronized.

#### Exact Attribute Value Examples
The exact value required for an attribute varies depending on the type of attribute, such as number, decimal, or measurement.

The following tables provide some specific examples of exact attribute values.

#### List Exception
Although SailWind Layout does not save exact List type values, it does change list entries to match the Attribute Dictionary entry.

For example, if the Attribute Dictionary entry for a list type attribute has Intel, IBM, and AMD as list choices, and you enter intel as a value, SailWind Layout changes the entry to Intel. The lowercase i is changed to uppercase. The following table lists exceptions for voltage measures.

**Table 88. Measure, Voltage Attribute Exceptions**

#### Measure, Geometry.Height (Size/Dimension) Attribute Exceptions
If you do not specify a unit of measure for a Size/Dimension Measure type attribute, SailWind Layout does not save the exact value.

The value is not saved because a number in the attribute value without a unit creates confusion if you change the current units.

| V 4.0 and higher Input |               | V 4.0 and higher Output for Current Units |         |             |  |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|--|
| String                 | Current Units | Mils                                      | Inches  | Metric (mm) |  |
| 10                     | mils          | 10mil                                     | 0.01"   | 0.254mm     |  |
| 0.1                    | inches        | 100mil                                    | 0.1"    | 2.54mm      |  |
| 10                     | metric        | 39.37mil                                  | 0.3937" | 10mm        |  |

**Table 89. Measure, Geometry Height Attribute Exceptions**

**Tip** Using a non-standard format for your value might cause SailWind Layout to change the value even if you do not change the current units. For example entering a value of 0001.2000mil, causes SailWind Layout to change the value to 1.2mil.

#### Default Units
You can include a unit with an attribute value. SailWind Layout provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) acceptable for input and for output.

SailWind Layout uses Systeme Internationale units, or SI units. Units are exported with attributes and are converted appropriately. User-defined units (dollar, yen, feet, pound, ounces/sq. foot, and so on) are not converted. Also, you cannot use prefixes with user-defined units.

The following units are supported, but are either enabled or disabled for actual use within SailWind Layout. To change the units that appear in this list, see Customizing Units for Attributes.

**Tip**

An extra comma (,) means that you can enter the abbreviation for the unit without a prefix. For example, you can enter O for Ohm in an attribute value; it is a valid value. You cannot, however, add F for Farad in an attribute value; it is not a valid value. You must use Farad with a prefix.

**Supported Units**

The following table lists units that are supported in SailWind Layout.

**Table 91. Unit Prefixes**

#### Customizing Units for Attributes
In addition to the standard attributes, you can add and modify custom attributes to a design to meet your own specialized requirements.

**Procedure**

- 1. Navigate to the *C:\<install\_folder>\<version>\Programs* folder.
- 2. Open the *SailWindpcb.ini* file in a text editor, such as Notepad.
- 3. Add a new attribute unit section by typing the header [SI Units].
- 4. Make modifications as required:
	- a. To Enable Units:
		- i. To enable units, delete the "ignore;" variable from the line. For example, the line for the Gram unit reads:

```
Gram=ignore;u,m,,k
```
ii. Modify the line so it reads:

Gram=u,m,,k

- b. To Disable Units:
	- i. To disable units, add the "ignore;" variable to the line. For example, the line for the Farad unit reads:

Farad=p,n,u,m

ii. Modify the line so it reads:

Farad=ignore;p,n,u,m

- iii. It is recommended that you leave the unit prefixes intact even when disabling the unit. This makes it easier to enable the unit later because you will not have to specify prefixes again.
- 5. Save the *SailWindpcb.ini* file.

**Related Topics**

.ini File Format for Units

#### .ini File Format for Units
Specify units in the [SI Units] section of the *.ini* file.

Use the following format:

<full unit name>=[ignore;][input:<prefix list>;][output:<prefix list>]

| <full unit name> | Specifies the name of the unit.                                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ignore;]        | Specifies whether to ignore the unit. If this variable is included,<br>the unit is ignored. To enable the unit remove this variable. |

**Table 92. where:**

**Table 92. where:(continued)**

| [input:<prefix list>;] | Specifies that you are creating a list of prefixes that are valid<br>for input into SailWind Layout.  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [output:<prefix list>] | Specifies that you are creating a list of prefixes that are valid<br>for output from SailWind Layout. |

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_27_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** You can list the valid prefixes after the equal sign (=) and those prefixes are used for both input and output.

### Attribute Types
You can assign many types of attributes to the objects in your designs, including the free-text type, the yes/no type, and the list type.

The Free Text Attribute Type The Yes/No Attribute Type The List Attribute Type The Measure Attribute Type Creating a Number or Decimal Number Type Attribute

#### The Free Text Attribute Type
You can select the Free Text attribute type to use any text as the attribute value. This is the default. Free text is not "intelligent," meaning you can type the name of the net as an attribute, but renaming the net does not update the attribute.

With the Free Text type you can select the Case-sensitive parameter to preserve the letter case of Free Text entries. This setting affects sorting and matching in the Find Dialog Boxand the Attribute Manager Dialog Box.

#### The Yes/No Attribute Type
You can select the Yes/No attribute type to create a list where you can select "Yes" or "No" as the attribute value.

#### The List Attribute Type
The List attribute type allows you to create a list from which to choose the value.

Creating a List Type Attribute Deletion of List Entries

##### Creating a List Type Attribute
You can create a list of entries as options for the attribute value. For example, you can create a list of all of your part manufacturers that is used every time you assign the attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box, click **New**.
- 3. In the Attribute Properties dialog boxon page 1115, type the name of the new attribute to create in the Attribute text box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_29_Picture_10.jpeg)

Attribute names can be 255 characters long. You can use any printable character, including spaces, in an attribute name. A space, however, cannot be the first or last character, or the character after a dot in the attribute name (for example, xxx. xxx is illegal). Attribute names are not case sensitive, and they are defined for the entire design, not per object.

- 4. On the **Types** tab, select the List Type.
- 5. Type an attribute value in the List box and click **Set** to add the item to the list. Repeat as necessary.
- 6. You can select the Case-sensitive check box to preserve the letter case of List entries. This setting affects sorting and matching in the Find Dialog Boxand the Attribute Manager Dialog Box.

A space, however, cannot be the first or last character, or the character after a dot in the attribute name (for example, xxx. xxx is illegal). Attribute names are not case sensitive, and they are defined for the entire design, not per object.

- 4. On the **Types** tab, select the Measure type and perform one of the following:
	- In the Measure list, select an existing measurement unit. The abbreviation appears in the Abbr box, the unit in the Unit box, and the measure or quantity in the Quantity box.
	- Enter the details for a new measurement unit.
		- i. In the Abbr box, type the abbreviation to use for the unit.
		- ii. In the Unit box, type the name of the unit.

**Note:**

If you use the unit Mil, assign the attribute at the board level. Otherwise the unit will not change when you change units for the design (using the Options dialog box > **Global** category > General subcategoryon page 1531.

- iii. In the Quantity box, type the quantity, or what it measures.
- iv. Click **Set** to add the item to the list.
- v. In the Limits area, type a minimum value in the Min box and/or a maximum value in the Max box. SailWind Layout checks against the Limits area values. If an attribute has the Number, Decimal Number, or Measure type property, SailWind Layout checks the attribute value against this property. Leading zeros are removed, trailing zeros after the decimal point are removed, and numbers greater than 6 characters are rounded.
- 5. On the Objects tabon page 1111, assign settings and hierarchy to the objects to which you want to apply the attribute.
- 6. Click **OK** to close the Attribute Properties dialog box.

## Modifying Design Attribute Properties
Use the Attribute Dictionary to modify design attribute properties.

**Prerequisites**

If an attribute is ECO-Registered, you must be in ECO mode to modify the attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary Dialog Box, click the attribute to modify from the list. Default attributes and the design attributes are listed. You can select an attribute groupon page 1811 from the Group list to filter the view and display only a select group of attributes. Attributes are grouped if they are structured attributeson page 1862.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** If you select the Show Hidden check box, you can view attribute groups that have no visible attributes. You set whether an attribute is hidden on the **Objects** tab of the Attribute Properties dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_6.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

You can modify the default attributes; however, it is not recommended.

**3. Click Properties.**

4. In the Attribute Properties dialog box,on page 1115 click the **Types** tab, and click the type for the attribute.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_35_Picture_11.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

If you use the design unit Mil, assign the attribute at the board level, otherwise the unit will not change when you change units for the design (using the Options dialog box > **Global**  category > General subcategoryon page 1531).

- 5. Click the Objects tabon page 1111, and click the objects you want to restrict. You cannot assign the attribute to a restricted object. For example, if you are defining the properties for a Manufacturer attribute, you may want to restrict nets so they cannot have this attribute. Therefore, you would disable the Net object for the Manufacturer attribute.
- 6. To use the default hierarchy, click the Use Default Hierarchy check box. If you choose not to use the default hierarchy, you can modify it. Modifying the hierarchy is considered an advanced procedure.
- 7. If you want to enable ECO Registrationon page 1824 of the attribute, click the ECO Registered check box. If you enable ECO Registration, changes made to the attributes are recorded in the ECO file. Enabling ECO Registration also restricts you to modifying attributes while the ECO Toolbar is active (ECO mode).
- 8. Click **OK** when you finish setting attribute properties to return to the Attribute Dictionary dialog box.
- 9. Click **Close**.

## Deleting Design Attributes
Use the Attribute Dictionary to delete attributes in your design. If you delete a decal attribute, any labels associated with it now associate with non-decal attributes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Dictionary** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Dictionary dialog box, on page 1107click the attribute to delete from the list. You can select an attribute groupon page 1811 from the Group list to filter the view and display only a select group of attributes. Attributes are grouped if they are structured attributeson page 1862. Clear the Show Hidden check box to filter the list to show only attribute groups that contain at least one visible attribute.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_36_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

You can delete the default attributes; however, it is not recommended. Because the default attributes are only provided for your design and not assigned to objects, you do not need to delete these attributes.

- 3. Click **Delete**. If you select a hidden attribute, this button is unavailable. The message "Are you sure you want to delete attribute type XXX?" appears.
- 4. Click **Yes** to delete the attribute.

## Attribute Manager
Use the Attribute Manager to view a spreadsheet of all of the attributes on all objects in the design.

You can use the Attribute Manager to add, edit, and delete attribute values on multiple object types. You can also create value summaries of an attribute that is based on every value of the attribute assigned to objects of the same type. In other words, summaries are applied per attribute and apply to all objects on the same tab.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Hidden attributes are not available to the Attribute Manager and are not listed in the Show Attributes dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Note:**

Rows in the multi-column list are unavailable if the attribute is read-onlyon page 1853. Rows are also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824 and SailWind Layout is not in ECO modeon page 1824. Hidden attributes do not appear in the list. All objects appear in the multi-column list, regardless of whether they have attributes assigned to them. Objects that do not have attributes assigned to them have <none> in the cell under the attribute name. Objects that have attributes assigned to them, but not values, have blank cells under the attribute name.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_37_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** You can avoid DRC violations or shorts by placing attributes on Documentation layers if used in the design. If an attribute is displayed in the design, and placed on an Electrical layer it will show up as copper in the manufacturing documents. Place free text and attribute values on the Silkscreen Top layer or another documentation layer.

### Listing Design Objects
The multi-column list of the Attribute Manager catalogs design objects and the attributes assigned to them. Objects appear in the left column and their attribute names appear in the column headers.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box in the View area, click a view option:
- **Selected**  Lists attributes from the objects selected in the design. If you select objects in the design and then open the Attribute Manager, selected objects appear on their appropriate tab. If you do not select objects of a certain type, the tab is unavailable. To view other objects, use the Filter.
- **Filter**  Lists attributes from all of the objects in your design. This view option allows you to view attributes assigned to non-selectable objects, such as Decals and Part Types. When using the filter, type the first characters of the objects to view, type an asterisk (\*) after the character, and then click **Apply Filter**. The objects appear on the appropriate tab in the multi-column list.

### Selecting Attributes to List in the Attribute Manager
Use the Show Attributes dialog box to select attributes to list in the multi-column list of the Attribute Manager.

**Tip** You can use the **Select All** or **Unselect All** buttons to select all or clear all check boxes.

### Adding Attribute Values to Design Objects With the Attribute Manager
In the Attribute Manager, you can add an attribute and value to one or more objects that do not already have the attribute assigned to it. You can add values to cells with "<none>" in it, which means the attribute is available to the design but you have not already assigned it to an object.

You can add attribute values to a design object only for attributes that are available to the design. To create a new attribute for use with design objects, see "Creating Attributes for the Design". You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see "Default Units".

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add a hidden attribute, read-only attributeon page 1853, or ECO-registered attributeon page 1824 while not in ECO modeon page 1824.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, select a cell with <none> in it.
- 3. Click **Add**.
- 4. Type a value in the cell and press the Enter key.

**Tip** You can only add attribute values to a design object for attributes that are available to the design. To create a new attribute for use with design objects, see "Creating Attributes for  the Design". You can include a unit with the value.

- 4. Click **Yes** to delete the value.

The attribute and value are removed from the object and the cell value is <none>.

### Applying an Attribute Value to All Other Objects
In the Attribute Manager, you can apply an attribute value from one object to all other objects of the same type. In other words, you can set the same attribute value for all objects of the same type. Any existing values remain unchanged.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, click the cell whose attribute value you want to apply to the other objects on the tab.
- 3. Click **Fill Column**. The "Are you sure you want to fill <name of attribute> for all objects by <selected value>?" message appears.
- 4. Click **Yes** to apply the value. The attribute and its value are applied to the other cells in that column, except for Summary cells.

### Creating a Summary
Create and modify attribute summaries that are based on every value of the attribute assigned to objects of the same type. In other words, summaries apply per attribute and are summed up from all objects in the same tab of the multi-column list. You can also change the summary type. The summaries appear at the bottom of attribute columns.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Summaries are only available for Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types. The type is an attribute property. For more information, see "Attribute Types".
- Hidden attributes are not available to the Attribute Manager and are not listed in the Show Attributes dialog box.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 2. In the Attribute Manager Dialog Box, click **Show**.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_41_Picture_4.jpeg)

- 4. Select the check boxes for the summary types you want to create for each attribute type.
- 5. Click **OK** to return to the Attribute Manager dialog box. The summary you created appears in the last two rows of the multi-column list. If you enabled more than one summary, the second summary appears in the two rows following the first summary.
- 6. You can create summaries or edit the summary types for other attribute columns without going into the Show Attributes dialog box. In another qualified attribute column (Number, Decimal Number, and Measure attribute types), double-click in the cell of the first summary row (used for the title of the summary type).
- 7. Choose a summary from the list, and press the Enter key. The new summary information appears.

## Design Object Attributes
Use the resizable Object Attributes dialog box to add, modify, or remove attributes of single objects or multiple objects of the same type.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_42_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Rows in the multicolumn list are unavailable if the attribute is read-onlyon page 1853. Rows are also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824 and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_42_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Note:**

You can avoid DRC violations or shorts by placing attributes on Documentation layers if used in the design. If an attribute is displayed in the design, and placed on an Electrical layer it will show up as copper in the manufacturing documents. Place free text and attribute values on the Silkscreen Top layer or another documentation layer.

Assigning Attributes to Design Objects With the Object Attributes Dialog Modifying Attribute Values Removing Attributes Removing Attribute Values Adding Height Information to Design Components and Jumpers Adding an Attribute to All Objects in the Design

### Assigning Attributes to Design Objects With the Object Attributes Dialog
You can assign attributes to an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box.

For example, you can select multiple parts and assign attributes, but you cannot select parts and vias and assign attributes. The Object Attribute dialog box only shows attributes that apply to the objects you select.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object(s) to which you want to assign an attribute. You can only select objects of the same type.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item. The "Object Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1496 opens. For more information, see "Assigning Attributes to Design Objects With the  Object Attributes Dialog".
- 3. From the Groups list click an attribute groupon page 1811 to view. If you assign multiple attributes and some of those are structured attributeson page 1862, this list acts as a filter and allows you to choose the attribute group to view.
- 4. From the Attributes For list, select the attribute hierarchy level for which you want to assign an attribute. The hierarchy levels change, depending on the object you selected in step 1. For more information, see "Attribute Hierarchy".

**Note:**

You cannot select a hierarchy level if you have multiple objects selected. The attribute is assigned at the current level; for example, if you select multiple parts, attributes are assigned at the Component level.

- 5. Click **Add**. A new, blank attribute line appears in the Attribute list. The pointer appears in the blank cell in the Attribute column. This cell is also a list that contains the attributes that apply to the object type you selected in step 1. This list is based on entries in the Attribute Dictionary. For more information, see "Attribute Dictionary".
- 6. Click an attribute from the Attribute list, or type the name of a new attribute in the blank cell. You cannot add a hidden or read-onlyon page 1853 attribute. Lists the name of the attribute. Attributes names can be 255 characters long. You can use any printable character, including spaces, in an attribute name. A space, however, cannot be the first or last character in the attribute name. Attribute names are not case sensitive, and they are defined for the entire design, not per object.

**Tip** When you add a new attribute to the design, it is also added to the Attribute Dictionary.

7. Double-click in the blank cell in the Value column (next to the attribute you just added). Assign the value for the attribute. You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout also provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. The Level column lists the hierarchy level where the attribute is assigned. In other words, the attribute is inherited from the level that appears in this column. It takes its value from the Attributes For list. For more information, see "Default Units".

**Tip** If you use the design unit Mil, assign the attribute at the board level. Otherwise the unit will not change when you change units for the design (using the **Global** tab of the Options dialog box).

8. Click **Close** to close the Object Attributes dialog box.

**Tip** You can add the same attribute multiple times, as long as you add it to different levels of the attribute hierarchy.

### Modifying Attribute Values
You can modify the attribute values of an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box. When you select multiple objects to modify attributes, the Attributes list displays the union of all attribute names.

In other words, the Attributes list displays the attributes that belong to all of the selected objects. When you add an attribute, you add it to all selected objects, and when you delete a value, you delete it from all objects with that attribute. You can edit the value of a selected attribute if the current level defines the attribute.

For example, if the text in the "Level" column matches the text in the "Attribute For" list, you can edit the value. If the current level does not define the attribute (the text in the Level column does not match the text in the Attributes For list), SailWind Layout adds a new attribute for the current level that matches the attribute you want to edit. You can then edit the value in the new attribute. You cannot edit the name of an attribute. You can either delete the attribute entirely, using the Attribute Dictionaryon page 355, or add a new attribute with the correct attribute name.

**Procedure**

1. If the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824, enter ECO mode. To enter ECO mode, click the ECO Toolbar button. If you do not enter ECO mode first, a message appears, informing you that you need to enter ECO mode.

**Restriction:**

You cannot modify read-only attributeson page 1853.

For more information, see "ECO Options Dialog Box".

- 2. Select the object(s) to modify.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item. Attribute information about the selected object(s) appears in spreadsheet form in the "Object Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1496.
- 4. From the Groups list click an attribute groupon page 1811 to view. If you assign multiple attributes and some of those are structured attributeson page 1862, this list acts as a filter and allows you to choose the attribute group to view.
- 5. From the Attributes For list, click the attribute hierarchy level for which you want to assign an attribute. The hierarchy levels change, depending on the object you selected in step 1. For more information, see "Attribute Hierarchy".

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_44_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Note:**

You cannot click a hierarchy level if you have multiple objects selected. The attribute is assigned at the current level; for example, if you select multiple parts, attributes are assigned at the Component level.

- 6. Click the cell (in the Value column) of the attribute value to modify. If a cell is blank, it means that the attribute is assigned to the object, but has no value. It can also mean that the values differ for the selected objects.
- 7. Click **Edit**.
- 8. Type or click the new attribute value and press the Enter key. The new value is added to the objects. For more information, see "Attribute Values".

You can include a unit with the value. SailWind Layout provides a default set of units (and unit prefixes) that are accepted as input and used as output. For more information, see "Default Units".

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_45_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** If attribute values are not the same, the value for that attribute is blank. If you modify that value, the new value applies to all objects with that attribute. You can also remove values from attributes (assign the attribute with no value).

### Removing Attributes
You can remove an attribute of an object or objects of the same type using the Object Attributes dialog box. You can only delete attributes on the current level. If you delete an attribute and a value appears for the attribute at a higher level in the hierarchy, it applies to the current level.

To delete the attribute entirely from the design, use the Attribute Dictionaryon page 355.

**Procedure**

1. If the attribute is ECO-registeredon page 1824, enter ECO mode. To enter ECO mode, click the **ECO Toolbar** button. The ECO Options Dialog Boxappears. If you do not enter ECO mode first, a message appears, informing you that you must enter ECO mode.

**Tip** You cannot edit read-only attributeson page 1853.

- 2. Select the object(s) to edit.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item. The "Object Attributes Dialog Box"on page 1496 appears. Attribute information about the selected objects appears in spreadsheet form in the list.
- 4. From the Groups list click an attribute groupon page 1811 to view. If you assign multiple attributes and some of those are structured attributeson page 1862, this list acts as a filter and allows you to choose the attribute group to view.
- 5. Click the cell whose attribute value you want to delete.
- 6. Click **Delete**.

The attribute is removed from the objects.

- 7. Press the Spacebar key and the press the Enter key. The attribute is still assigned to the objects, but it has no value.

### Adding Height Information to Design Components and Jumpers
Height information prevents components from being placed in height-constrained areas. Height information is also important when exporting a design to a 3-dimensional modeling application.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_46_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** To quickly add height information to multiple objects, use the procedure in "Adding Attribute Values to Design Objects With the Attribute Manager".

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the object in the design.
- 2. Right-click, then click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Object Attributes Dialog Box, click the **Add** button.

**Note:** Some attributes require you to be in ECO Mode.

4. Type Geometry.Height, or select it from the list.

- 5. Enter a value.
- 6. Click the **Close** button.

### Adding an Attribute to All Objects in the Design
Add an attribute at the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy to apply the attribute to all objects in the design.

![](/layout/guide/18/_page_47_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** Attributes at this level have the lowest priority in the attribute hierarchy. For more information, see "Attribute Hierarchy."

**Procedure**

- 1. In the design, select an object (for example, a component, component pad, net, or via), right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Attributes for list, click PCB. Attributes of the PCB at the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy are displayed.
- 3. Click the **Add** button to add a new attribute.
- 4. In the new row, type a new attribute, or use the list to select a predefined attribute.
- 5. Type a value.
