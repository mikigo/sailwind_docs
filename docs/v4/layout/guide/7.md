# Chapter 7 Creating and Editing PCB Decals
A PCB decal is a software representation of the outline, terminals, and attributes of an electrical component. SailWind Layout uses PCB decals in the placement and routing of components during the design layout process.

The following topics present a detailed description of how to create and edit PCB Decals using the PCB Decal Editor. They also discuss the setup of the PCB Decal Editor as well as the process of updating a design from the library after you have edited the decals.

## Setting Up the PCB Decal Editor
You use the PCB Decal Editor to create new decals or to modify existing ones. You can modify the Decal Editor's layers, colors, rules, editor options, and Decal Wizard options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item to change the layer stackup in the Layers Setup on page 1441dialog box. If you need to add objects to specific layers, use the Layers Definition settings to configure the design to your requirements.
- 2. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item to change the colors of objects or layers in the Display Colors Setupon page 1318 dialog box. As you work on a decal, you may find it useful to apply different colors to objects or layers to visually differentiate them.

You can modify the colors of objects and layers in the Decal Editor, but when the decal is used by a component in the design, it uses the colors set for the design.

3. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item to change the options in the Options dialog boxon page 1531.

4. Click the **Setup> Decal Rules** menu item to change the decal rules in the Decal Rules on page 1231dialog box.

**Note:** Rules set at this level of the rules hierarchy are used only by SailWind Router.

[Creating a New Default Decal Editing Environment](#page-1-0)

## Creating a New Default Decal Editing Environment
SailWind Layout provides a default (start-up) decal editing environment that opens when you start the Decal Editor from the Tools menu. This decal editing environment has its own layers, colors, rules, and editor options settings. These settings are very generic in the out-of-the-box default environment.

If you have personal preferences or your company has specific design standards for decal creation, you can modify and save the default environment's settings to create a new default that will support those preferences. This can help you to improve productivity by loading your preferred setting each time the Decal Editor is opened.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item. The Decal Editor opens with the default configuration.
- 2. Set options and settings to reflect your personal preferences or company design standards. For more information, see "[Setting Up the PCB Decal Editor"](#page-0-0).
- 3. Click the **File> Save as Start-up File** menu item.
- 4. In the Start-up File Output dialog box, select the appropriate check boxes in the Sections area, and click**OK**.

When you immediately click the **File> New** menu item, you will see the new default settings.

## Setting Colors of Objects in the Decal Editor
As you work on a decal, you can customize display colors to make it easier to see objects as you place them.

Using the Display Colors Setup dialog box, you can:

- Set and change the color of objects on a per layer or per object type basis
- Make objects visible or invisible in the display (also on a per layer or per object type basis)
- Customize the palette of color selections
- Save your customizations in a configuration file

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to start the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Setup> Display Colors** menu item.
- 3. In the Display Colors Setup Dialog Boxon page 1322, set the color(s) you want:
	- a. To set the color for one object, in the Selected Color area, click a color tile. Then in the Layers/ Object Types table, click the tile for the object type in the correct layer row. To change the palette of colors from which you can select, click **Palette**. For more information, see "Changing the Color Palette".
	- b. To make all objects on a layer the same color, click the layer number to select the entire row, and then click the color tile in the Selected Color area.
	- c. To make an object the same color on all layers, click the object name to select the entire column, and then click the color tile in the Selected Color area.
	- d. To make an object type invisible, set its tile to the background color. You can make multiple objects invisible (for example, all objects on the same layer). For more information, see "Hiding Design Objects".

To make an object type the same color on all layers, click the **Assign All** button and use the Assign Color to All Layers dialog box.on page 1094

**4. Click Apply.**

If you modify the display color settings, you can save the new configuration to a file for reuse in future design sessions. For more information, see "Saving Color Assignments to a File".

## Creation of a New Decal
In the PCB Decal Editor, you can use the Decal Wizard to create some footprints automatically, or use the Drafting Toolbar commands to manually create a decal.

[Creating a Basic Decal Automatically](#page-3-1) [The Decal Wizard Options Configuration File](#page-3-2) [Creating a Decal Manually](#page-4-0)

### Creating a Basic Decal Automatically
Use the Decal Wizard to automatically create common decal types based on settings you provide in the Decal Wizard dialog box.

In order to create a decal, you need to begin with the package dimensions and enlarge the decal to the appropriate material conditionon page 1838.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to start the Decal Editor.
- 2. On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Drafting Toolbar** button to open the Drafting Toolbar, and then click the **Wizard** button.
- 3. Choose one of these methods to calculate the required dimensions and create a new PCB decal:
	- **Manually Calculate the Required Decal Dimensions**  You manually calculate the decal dimensions required for the package and enter the dimensions into the Decal Wizard to create the new decal.
	- **Use the Decal Calculator to Generate the Required Dimensions**  You enter the package dimensions into the Decal Calculator area of the dialog box (if the feature is available for the specific component family) and let the Decal Calculator generate the decal according to preset standards of material conditions.
- 4. After you create the basic decal, you can edit it to add other items, such as labels, attributes, keepouts, solder mask relief, height values, and hard breakouts/fanouts. For more information, see "Decal [Editing](#page-12-0) Tasks".

[The Decal Wizard Options Configuration File](#page-3-2)

### The Decal Wizard Options Configuration File
You cannot modify or delete the Default configuration of the Decal Wizard Options but you can save a new configuration file.

This configuration file is saved in the *UserDir* folder. The *UserDir* environment variable is set in the *\Settings\SailWindpcb.ini* file, and by default is set to the *\Settings\* folder. The file has an extension of *.dwc*. These files are in text format and can be opened with your default text editor.

**Custom Package Types and Pitch Ranges**

You can use your default text editor to further customize the configuration file you saved from the Decal Wizard Options dialog box. You can edit the existing package types or add new package types.

If you edit the text of your *.dwc* file, you must consider the following requirements:

- Only pre-defined component families can be used, and all the required parameters for the component family must exist (for example, Toe).
- The component\_type section numbers must not skip a number; however they do not need to be in consecutive order in the file. For example, if numbers 4 and 6 exist, there must also be a number 5 somewhere in the file.
- Pitch ranges cannot overlap and, all together, must cover all values from 0 to infinity.
- The DecalName parameters are restricted to <Pitch>, <LeadSpan>, <LeadSpan1>, <LeadSpan2>, <Height>, <BodyWidth>, <BodyLength>, and <PinCount>.

If these requirements are not met and you attempt to use the configuration in the Decal Wizard Options dialog box, a warning appears to explain the problem and you cannot use the configuration file.

### Creating a Decal Manually
If you cannot create a decal using the decal wizard, you can create it manually using the Decal Editor Drafting Toolbar buttons.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to start the Decal Editor with the default decal editing environment.

You do not have to start with the default decal when creating a new decal. If the new decal you want to create will be similar to an existing decal, you can edit that decal and save it under a new name to create the new decal.

- 2. [Set the decal originon page 170.](#page-13-0)
- 3. [Add and place the terminalson page 172](#page-15-0).
- 4. [Create any copper shapeson page 179,](#page-22-0) such as copper associated with terminal pads.
- 5. [Define the terminal pad stackson page 185.](#page-28-0)
- 6. Create the [Assemblyon page 195](#page-38-0), [Silkscreenon page 196](#page-39-0) and [Placementon page 197](#page-40-0) part outlines.
- 7. Add other items, such as labels, attributes, keepouts, solder mask relief, height values, and hard breakouts/fanouts. For more information, see "Decal [Editing](#page-12-0) Tasks".
- You cannot edit the default "Name" and "Type" labels that appear when you create a new decal; these "placeholder" labels are automatically populated with the correct reference designator and part type name, respectively, when a part using the decal is added to a design.
- You can add other "placeholder" labels to a decal. For more information, see "[Creating](#page-44-0) [Placeholder Attribute Labels"](#page-44-0).
- 8. Click the **File> Save Decal As** menu item, name the new decal and save it to a library.

Library Content and the Search Order

## Library and Component Decal Edits
You can edit a library decal or the decal assigned to a component in a design.

[Modifications to Components](#page-6-1) [Editing a Library Decal](#page-7-0) [Checking](#page-8-0) for Errors Between Part Types and Assigned PCB Decals [Fixing Logical Errors](#page-8-1) [Fixing Mismatched Pins Errors](#page-9-0) [Editing the Decal Assigned to a Component in the Design](#page-10-0)

### Modifications to Components
When you add a component from the library to a design, the component is copied from the library into the design as a separate instance.

There are then two versions of the component - the library version and the design version. You can modify either or both of these; but which one you modify makes a difference:

- If you want the changes to apply only to the Library version of the component, use the PCB Decal Editor to make the changes. If you modify the Library version of a component, only that version is changed; instances of the component existing in the design are not changed. (If you want to change the design components to match the Library version, you can click the **Tools > Update from Library** menu item.)
- If you want the changes you make to apply only to the component(s) in the current design, use the Layout Editor to make the changes. If you modify the design version of a component, the change affects only the selected component(s) in the current design (or all instances of that component in the design); the Library definition of the component is not changed (unless you specifically change it by right-clicking and clicking the **Save to Library** popup menu item with the component selected in the design).

Most of the items that make up a component definition can be edited only in the Layout editor, or only in the PCB Decal Editor, not in both places. But the following items can be edited in either editor, and you must decide which editor to use:

- In the component part type:
	- Attributes
- In the component's decals:
	- Attributes
	- Labels
	- Silkscreen
	- Keepouts
- Copper
- Solder mask
- Paste mask
- Part outline width
- Decal rules
- Pad stack

### Editing a Library Decal
You can use the Decal Editor to modify PCB Decals in a library. The changes you make apply at the library level but do not apply automatically to instances within the design.

### Editing the Decal Assigned to a Component in the Design
You can edit the decal that one or more selected components in the design are using and apply the changes to those components alone, or to all the components in the design using the decal.

You can also save the changes to the existing decal in the library, or create a new decal.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the component(s). The selected components must all use the same decal.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Edit Decal** popup menu item to open the PCB Decal Editor.
- 3. Edit the decal. For information on how to edit a PCB decal, see "Decal [Editing](#page-12-0) Tasks."

**Restriction:**

If your design is in default layer mode and you edit a design decal and attempt to change it to increased layer mode, the message "You will not be able to apply decal changes to the design. Continue?" appears. Either click **Cancel** to return to the Layers Setup Dialog box without changing the decal to increased layer mode, or click **OK** to proceed to the Increase Maximum Layer Number dialog box, where you can save the decal changes to the library; then exit the PCB Decal Editor without applying changes. After you have completed the edits to the decal in the library, you can then switch the current design to increased layer mode and update the decal.

4. If you want to save changes to the library:

- a. Click the **File> Save Decal As** menu item.
- b. In the Save PCB Decal to Library dialog box, set the Library and Name of PCB Decal fields to save the changes to a new decal. If you want to save the changes to the existing decal, leave the fields as they are.
- c. Click **OK**.
- 5. Click the **File> Exit Decal Editor** menu item.
- 6. In the Apply Decal Changes dialog box, Click **Selected** to apply the changes to the selected components only, or **All** to apply the changes to all components using that decal in the design.

## Decal Editing Tasks
You can use the Decal Editor to perform editing tasks, including editing properties, locating the decal origin, adding, deleting and modifying terminals, creating and associating copper shapes, creating and modifying custom pad stacks, working with labels and attributes, and a multitude of other editing tasks.

SailWind Layout combines decals and part types to create components. Use the PCB Decal Editor to create and edit the decal associated with a part type in the parts library. Many PCB Decal Editor drafting operations are identical to Layout Editor drafting operations.

When the PCB Decal Editor starts, your current design is stored and PCB Decal Editor takes over. The colors used in the PCB Decal Editor come from the Layout Editor. When you exit the PCB Decal Editor, use File commands to save information, and exit as you would a stand-alone program. You will return to the current design in SailWind Layout.

When editing decals, note the following:

- SailWind Layout supports 16 alternate decals per part type.
- You can use Dimensioning within the PCB Decal Editor; however, dimensions are converted to 2D lines and text when you save the decal. For more information, see the Dimensioning Process topic.

PCB Decal Editor drafting works with the objects that make up a decal:

- Decal name
- Terminals
- 2D lines
- Text
- Copper
- Copper voids

### Editing the Properties of a Decal Item
You can edit the properties of decal items, including terminals, labels, text, and 2D items.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Decal Editor, select an item then right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. You can also Double-click on the item, or select the item and click the **Properties** button on the Decal Editor Toolbar.
- 2. In the displayed dialog box, edit the decal name properties.
- 3. Click **OK**.

### Location of the Decal Origin
The location of a decal's origin affects how decals attach to the cursor when you move a component in the Move by Origin mode. It also affects how pick and place machines populate the board with components.

Typically, through-hole devices have their origin at Pin 1, and surface-mount devices at the geometric center of the component; other devices may have other origin requirements.

When you are creating a new decal, you can define the origin whenever it is most convenient. For example, if you are creating a through-hole device decal:

- You could create Pin 1 on the default origin, and then build the remainder of the decal relative to that origin.
- You could build the entire decal anywhere within the workspace, and then move the origin to Pin 1.

### Setting the Decal Origin with Set Origin
You can set a decal's origin while you are editing it in the Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Origin** menu item.
- 2. Click where you want the new origin to be.

### Setting the Decal Origin Using a Modeless Command
You can set a decal's origin by using a modeless command and specifying the x and y location coordinates.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the decal.
- 2. Type the modeless command SO <x> <y>.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** Type SO for relative coordinates, SOA for absolute coordinates.

### Terminals
Terminals define the physical connection points on the PCB decals. The terminal Properties establish the connectivity relationship between the schematic symbol and the PCB decal.

#### Terminal Renumbering
When constructing PCB decals, you may need to renumber the terminals. There are two methods to renumber terminals.

#### Renumbering by Clicking Terminals
In the Decal Editor, you can renumber terminals in ascending order by selecting the starting terminal and clicking consecutive terminals.

**Procedure**

1. With a decal open in the PCB Decal Editor, select a starting terminal, right-click, and then click the **Renumber Terminals** popup menu item.

Renumber Terminals is not available if more than one terminal is selected.

- 2. In the Start pin number area, type values in the Prefix and/or Suffix boxes. A preview of pin numbers based on your input is displayed below the boxes.
	- Alphabetic and numeric values can be used in either box. For example, A1 or 1A.
	- For a single numeric, use either Prefix or Suffix box, and clear the other box.
- 3. In the Increment options area, choose what to increment by clicking either the Increment prefix or Increment suffix option.
- 4. In the Step value box, type a positive or negative number by which to increase or decrease the pin numbers with consecutive or stepped values.
- 5. If using alphanumerics, you can select the Use JEDEC pin numbering check box to ensure that legal alphanumeric values are used.

This option only ensures that legal alphanumeric combinations are used. To arrange rows and columns according to JEDEC, use the **Tools > Assign JEDEC Pinning** menu item.

- 6. Click **OK**.
	- The terminal is highlighted, and the pointer changes to a small cross. The pointer dynamically attaches to the renumbered terminal. The message "Renumbering… Next New Number: #" also attaches to the pointer.
	- If you have duplicate numbers during the renumbering process, the duplicate numbers appear with a tilde (~) next to them.
- 7. Select another terminal to assign the next available number.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_20_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** If you have renamed all available pins, the message "Renumbering... New Numbers Exhausted!" appears. In other words, the message appears if you renumber all eight terminals on a decal with eight pins.

- 8. You can back up in the numbering process. Right-click and click the **Back** popup menu item or press the Backspace key to restore the original number. If you selected a group of terminals to renumber, Back will undo the renumbering one terminal at a time. To undo completed terminal renumbering click Undo from the Edit menu.
- 9. To cancel the terminal renumbering process at any time, right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item. SailWind Layout restores the original terminal numbering.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_21_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** To renumber multiple terminals, click and hold the left mouse button, then drag the pointer across the terminals while pressing the Shift key. When you release the mouse button, all of the selected terminal numbers update, excluding terminals that are already renumbered.

10. Right-click and click the **Complete** popup menu item when you finish reassigning terminal numbers.

#### Renumber Using the Pin Numbers Dialog Box
You can use the Pin Numbers dialog box to interactively renumber the terminals in the design area. Selecting pin numbers in the dialog box selects the matching pins in the design area and selecting pins in the design area selects the matching pins in the dialog box.

The Pin Numbers dialog box can be accessed from the **Setup> Pin Numbers** menu item.

You can modify the pin numbers listed in the dialog box, by editing individual cells, by copying and pasting, or by using the Renumber Pins dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_21_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** Pin number changes on the decal will not be updated until you click **Apply** or **OK**.

#### Editing Individual Pin Numbers
You can use the Renumber Pins dialog box to edit individual pin numbers on a decal.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Pin Numbers** menu item.
- 2. Double click a Number cell, or select a number cell and click **Edit**.
- 3. Type a new pin number.

### Creating Copper in the Decal
You can create copper in the decal and associate it with a pin to create a custom pad shape or heat sink. You can also create unassociated copper heat sink or shielding shapes that move with the decal in the design.

**Prerequisites**

You must select a layer for placement of the copper. You cannot create a copper shape on all layers (layer number zero). If you need the same copper shape on multiple layers, copy the shape to the other layers.

- 1. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button.
- 2. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper** button.
- 3. Select a layer on which to place the copper.
- 4. Right-click and click a command to change the values of the drafting object. For more information, see "Set Values Before Creating a Drafting Object".
- 5. Create the shape using one of the following:
	- Creating a Circle Drafting Object
	- Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object
	- Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object
- 6. Once you complete the shape, it becomes a filled shape.

**Results**

Examine the resulting copper shape and look for any of these conditions:

- If the shape edges are not correct, see "Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615".
- If the shape is on the wrong layer or needs to be modified, see "Drafting Object Properties".
- If you want to start over, see "Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object".

### Surface Mount Device Pads
Surface Mount Device (SMD) pads are usually rectangular, although you can assign any shape. When defining an SMD pad, set the pad stack for all other layers to a round shape, size 0 pad, drill size 0, and clear Plating. The drill oversize parameter does not apply. If you use associated copper to define the SMD pad, set the pad stack for that layer to a square shape, size 0.

Use the Via under SMD routing command to place vias directly under SMD pads. For more information, see "Adding Vias in Pads". You can undersize the SMD pads for the paste mask photoplot during the CAM process.

**Plane Connections**

Pins that are supposed to connect to the plane are usually plotted for manufacturing using spoked thermal relief pads.

### Creation of Custom Pad Shapes
You can create odd shaped (irregular shaped) pads by drawing a copper shape and associating it to the pad while editing the decal.

<span id="page-24-0"></span>For more information, see "[Associating](#page-24-0) Copper with Terminals".

### Associating Copper with Terminals
You can associate a drawn copper shape with a terminal/pad. This assigns the copper shape the same net connection as the terminal/pad. Use associated copper to create custom pad shapes or to create hard breakouts in decals.

CAM interprets pads and other objects differently when they are associated with copper in the PCB Decal Editor. Interpretation is as follows:

- Terminals are interpreted as vias
- Closed copper shapes are interpreted as pads
- Open copper (a path drawn with copper) is interpreted as a trace

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_24_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** Using the Vias, Pads, and Traces check boxes along with those in the Pins with Associated Copper area will give you total control over what appears in your CAM document.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Routing is only completed to the center of the pad and any thermal connections are made to the pad only and not the associated copper shape.

**Procedure**

1. Draw the copper shape. For more information, see ["Creating Copper in the Decal](#page-22-0)".

You can create multiple copper shapes.

- 2. With a decal open in the PCB Decal Editor, select a terminal, right-click and then click the **Associate** popup menu item.
- 3. Select the copper item to associate with the terminal. This electrically connects the copper item with the terminal. You may want to physically connect the terminal and copper item by overlaying part or all of the terminal.
- 4. If you are using the associated copper to create an odd shaped pad, maximize the pad shape inside the overlapping associated-copper shape. The underlying pad is still the routing target on page 1854 and also the connection point for thermals if this pad will ever be connected to a copper plane. If associated copper surrounds the terminal pin by a large amount it could prevent thermal spokes from being generated.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_24_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Note:**

When routing to a decal pad with associated copper in the design editor, the trace is flagged as a partial connection if you route only to the associated copper, and not to the center of the decal pad itself. Note, however, that though the connection is flagged as partial, it will result in a functional connection on the finished board.

**Results**

CAM interprets terminals differently when associated with copper. For more information, see Associated Copper and CAM.

### Unassociating Copper from Terminals
You can remove the association between a copper item and a terminal.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Decal Editor, select the copper item.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Unassociate** popup menu item.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_25_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** As an alternative, in the Terminal Properties, you can clear the Associated Copper check box to unassociate copper from the terminal.

### Pad Sizes and Pad Stacks
A *pad* is a small area of copper that acts as a conductor for component pins and vias. The pad ensures connectivity between the trace entering the drill hole and the copper plating that lines the inside of the hole.

Pads are classified as two types:

- **Through hole pads**  Are used for components that mount with pins that go through the board. When through hole pads are drilled and plated, a small ring of copper remains and ensures connectivity between the trace entering the drill hole, the copper plating that lines the inside of the hole, and the pad on the opposite side of the board. Vias are considered through hole pads, but may be created to go through only certain layers.
- **Surface mount pads**  Are used for components that have pins, which are glued to an outside layer of the board. Routing to vias provides connectivity to other layers.

[Pad Stacks](#page-26-1) [Pad Stack Default Layers](#page-27-1) [Pad Stacks and Antipad Definitions](#page-27-2) [Pad Stacks and Associated Copper](#page-27-3)

#### Pad Stacks
On a two-layer board, a component pin or via drill hole has a separate pad on the top layer and the bottom layer. You can set different shape, size, and diameter values for each pad. If you add any inner routing layers to the design, you can define pads on those layers. The resulting two or more pads for the pin or via is called the *pad stack*.

Pad stacks are classified into two categories:

- **Component pad stacks**  Component pad stacks are used for component pins and are either surface mount, with no drill diameter, or through hole. Pad stack information for a component is stored with its part decal information.
- **Via pad stacks** Via pad stacks are used for feed-throughs and can be through hole or partial. Partial vias begin or end on an outer or inner layer. Partial vias are used on multilayer boards and are created by drilling laminate layers separately for layer-dedicated vias, then pressing them together and drilling the through holes. If a via connects an outer layer and an inner layer, it is called a blind via. If a via connects two inner layers, it is called a buried via. The via type determines whether a via is through hole or partial. The via description is the combination of type, plating, and pad stack information.

You can edit pad stacks by layer, so you can set component or via pads to zero, turning them off, on layers where they are not needed to create more routing real estate around a drill hole. You can assign different shapes to them for different routing or photoplot applications. The resulting configuration of size, shape, diameter, and layer description for a pad stack is called its pad stack information. For more information, see the [Editing Pad Stacks](#page-31-0)topic.

For information on installing vias, see the Via Setup on page 327 topics.

#### Pad Stack Default Layers
The default layer list features a special generic layer list. It lists Mounted Side, Inner Layers, and Opposite Side. Such a setup allows quick customization of the electrical layers and adds flexibility if you choose to mount the component on the bottom side or add extra inner layers.

**Mounted/Opposite Side**

If you customize the Mounted Side or Opposite Side, your customized pad will flip with the component if you choose to mount the component on the bottom side of the board. However, if you choose to customize the specific layer of your top or bottom side of the board, that customized pad will remain on that layer even though you flip the component.

**Inner Layers**

If you customize the Inner Layers, you can add layers to your design and your pad customizations will propagate to any added. However, if you choose to customize each specific layer, and you increase the layers of your design, your customized pads will remain only on those specific internal layers.

#### Pad Stacks and Antipad Definitions
Setting an antipad definition for the inner layer modifies the photoplot output for CAM planes and split/ mixed planes. If you want a unique antipad on split/mixed plane layers, add a new layer for the split/mixed plane before defining the antipad.

**Related Topics**

Setting Up an Inner Layer

#### Pad Stacks and Associated Copper
When defining associated copper for a terminal, define a zero size, square-shaped pad in the terminal pad stack on the layer of the associated copper. Routing commands interpret the zero size, squareshaped pad to be the routing target for the associated pad copper on that layer.

### Drill Size
During manufacturing, the interior surfaces of drill holes are coated with metal plating. For vias, the plating enables connectivity when the layers are pressed together. Plating reduces the diameter of drilled holes. The size difference does not affect vias as much as component holes, where a smaller diameter can hinder part insertion.

The drill size you define for a pad stack is assumed to be the finished hole size, after plating. Manufacturing should use a larger drill bit than the specified drill size specified so that once the plating is added, the resulting inner diameter is at, or close to, the original finished specification. So that you can use the actual drill bit size in clearance checking, there is a universal "Drill oversize" setting on the **Design** tab of the Options dialog box, which adds a fixed amount of diameter to all drill size definitions. The combination of the pad stack drill size and the drill oversize setting is the diameter used by the batch design rule checks. This is also the drill hole size that displays on a pin or via.

In most cases, manufacturers use drill sizes equal to the pad stack drill size plus twice the thickness of the plating. To determine what value to enter, know how your board manufacturer chooses drill diameters.

### Customizing Pad Stacks of Decal Pins
You can customize the pad stacks of the pins in your decal. You can choose to customize one pin, or multiple pins simultaneously.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When customizing pad stacks of decal pins, the following restrictions apply

- If you are working in the PCB Decal Editor, you must have a decal open in the editor. The terminals (pins) must exist in your decal before you can modify their default pad stacks.
- If you are working in the Design Editor, the decal you want to edit must exist in the design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item.
- 2. In the "Pad Stacks Properties Dialog Box"on page 1566, ensure that your decal is selected in the Decal name list.
- 3. Under the "Pin: Plated:" list, select the pin to customize. If you do not want to customize all the pins simultaneously, you can add one or more specific pin numbers to the list using the Add Pin Dialog Box.on page 1066
- 4. Under the "Sh: Sz: Layer:" list, select one or more layers of the pad stack you want to customize.

For more information, see:

- [Pad Stack Default Layers on page 184](#page-27-1)
- [Control of Solder Mask and Paste Mask](#page-52-1)
- 5. In the Parameters area, specify the settings for all three **Pad**, **Thermal**, and **Antipad** pad styles if needed. The style of pad used is selected automatically in the design depending on the situation. The thermal and antipad styles are used when the pin is located within a plane.

For more information, see:

- "Design Rule Versus Pad Stack Thermals and Antipads" on page 797
- [Creation of Thermals in the Pad Stacks](#page-29-0)
- [Creation of Antipads in the Pad Stacks](#page-30-0)
- Customizing Design Rule Thermals.
- 6. Below the Parameters area, set the options that apply to the pads on all layers for the selected pin(s).
- 7. If you need to customize other pins in the decal, return to step 3.
- 8. Click **OK** to save all the pad stack customizations.

**Results**

Verify that your custom thermals are showing up in CAM plane plots. For custom thermals to be visible, you must select the Use Custom Thermal Settings check box in the Plot Options Dialog Boxand ensure that the photo plotter format is RS-274-X. Custom thermals for CAM planes are not supported by RS-274- D.

### Creation of Thermals in the Pad Stacks
You can set up thermals wherever you can create or modify pad stacks. Create thermals on split/mixed plane layers and CAM negative planes (for RS-274-X output).

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When creating thermals in pad stacks, the following restrictions apply:

• In the PCB Decal Editor, thermals cannot be created in the Pad Stack Properties for Pin dialog box. Instead, click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item to use the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_29_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** The Sh: Sz: Layer: area of these dialog boxes contains one global listing for inner layers, listed as <Inner Layers>. Setting a thermal definition for this inner layer modifies the photoplot output for CAM plane and split/mixed plane layers. If you want a unique thermal on a particular layer, add the new layer and define the specific thermal setting.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select one or more layers.
- 2. In the Parameters area, click the **Thermal** tab.
- 3. Click the appropriate pad shape to enable the size and shape controls for thermals.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_29_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** The pad stack thermal settings use oval and rectangular shapes for slotted holes as well as for oval and rectangular pads.

4. Change the default thermal values in the fields provided. No pad stack thermal will be used if the "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" check box is selected in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > Thermals subcategoryon page 1514. For more information, see ""Customizing Design Rule Thermals"on page 669".

**Note:**

CAM planes are negative images compared to other layers. When you set thermals for CAM plane layers, you must select the Use Custom Thermal Settings check box in the Plot Optionson page 1641 dialog box. Make sure you are also using RS-274-X output format in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setupon page 1619 dialog box.

**Related Topics**

[Customizing Pad Stacks of Decal Pins](#page-28-0)

### Creation of Antipads in the Pad Stacks
Antipads are set up wherever pad stacks can be created or modified. Create antipads on split/mixed plane layers and CAM negative planes (for RS-274-X output).

**Restrictions and Limitations**

In the PCB Decal Editor, antipads cannot be created in the Pad Stack Properties for Pin dialog box. Instead, click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item to use the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box.

**Procedure**

1. Select one or more layers.

The Sh: Sz: Layer: area of these dialog boxes contains one global listing for inner layers, listed as <Inner Layers>. Setting an antipad definition for this inner layer modifies the photoplot output for CAM plane and split/mixed plane layers. If you want a unique antipad on a particular layer, add the new layer, and define the specific antipad setting.

Antipads are not found when using the generic Mounted Side and Opposite side layers. If you want a custom antipad for the top and bottom layers, you need to add the specific layer.

- 2. In the Parameters area, click the **Antipad** tab.
- 3. Click the appropriate pad shape to enable the size and shape controls for antipads. The pad stack antipad settings use oval and rectangular shapes for slotted holes as well as for oval and rectangular pads.
- 4. Change the default antipad value in the field provided. No pad stack antipad will be used if the "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" check box is selected in the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > Thermals subcategoryon page 1514. For more information, see "Customizing Design Rule Antipads"on page 670.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_30_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Note:**

CAM planes are negative images compared to other layers. When you set antipads for CAM plane layers, you must select the "Use Custom Thermal Settings" check box in the Plot Optionson page 1641 dialog box. Make sure you are also using RS-274-X output format in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setupon page 1619 dialog box.

**Related Topics**

[Customizing Pad Stacks of Decal Pins](#page-28-0)

### Editing Pad Stacks
Pad information for the selected decal is listed by pin number to the right of the Setup/Pad Stack form. A typical decal uses one pad stack description for all its pins. This practice has some common exceptions. For example, a square pad usually designates pin 1 of through-hole components.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item.
- 2. Set the pad stack type to Decal or Via.
- 3. Click the decal or via name from the Decal Name list.
- 4. Make your changes and then click **OK**.
- 5. When you are prompted to save changes to all or the selected parts click the appropriate button:
	- **All**  Use this choice to assign the decal name to the part type and for all part types in the design using this decal to assume the new pad stack definition.
	- **Selected**  Use this choice to rename the individual component's decal using a suffix letter; for example a DIP16 with a local pad stack edit becomes DIP16A. This decal name becomes the only decal listing, primary or alternate, for this particular reference designator.

**Related Topics**

[Customizing Pad Stacks of Decal Pins](#page-28-0)

### Editing a Pad Stack in the PCB Decal Editor
Edit a pad stack in the PCB Decal Editor to change the pad stack of a single pin or to make pad stack changes and save them to the library before adding parts to the design.

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Open a decal.
- 3. Select the pin or pins for which you want to change the pad stack. Alternatively, click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item and select or add the specific pad stack that needs to be edited.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Pad Stacks** popup menu item. The Pad Stack Properties for Pin Dialog Boxappears.
- 5. In the "Pin No. Plated": area, click the pin you want to change, then in the "Sh: Sz: Layer:" area, click a layer on which you want to change the pad stack information. If you opened the Pad Stacks properties dialog box from the Setup menu, you can edit multiple pad stack layers at once.
- 6. Make the pad stack modifications.
- 7. Click the "Assign to all selected pins" check box to apply the modifications to all of the selected pins. Selected pins appear in the Pin Name list.
- 8. Click **OK**. The pad stack changes are applied to every selected pin. To save the changes, you must also save the decal.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_32_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Note:** To work with pad stacks on library parts before they are added to the design, enter the PCB Decal Editor through the Library Manager. This lets you include decal names in the part's alternate decals, ensuring smoother operation if you refresh a part type in the design with a definition from the library.

**Related Topics**

Part Information Dialog Box, PCB Decals Tab

### Saving Pad Stack Changes to the Decal Library
Changing the pad stack definition for a single part or for all parts does not change the decal in the part's library definition. Use the Library Manager to include any new decal names in the part's alternate decals. This ensures a smoother operation if you ever refresh the part type in the design with a new definition from the library. You can save pad stack changes to the parts library.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the part.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Save to Library** popup menu item. The Save Part Types and Decals dialog box shows the selected part type and all of its alternate decals as of the last time it was read or refreshed.

If you created a new suffixed decal, meaning you changed the pad stack for one component only, the new decal also appears.

3. Highlight either the decal you changed or the new decal and the library where you keep the decals.

### Pad Stack Report
You can create a text format, pad stack report file for a selected component or via or all components and vias.

A sample file output appears below.

```

### Slotted Holes
You can create slotted holes using the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box or the Pad Stacks Properties for Pins dialog box. Slotted holes have orientation and offset properties, but have the same unit and range as the associated pad's orientation and offset. You can use slotted holes with only round, square, oval, or rectangular pad shapes.

Therefore, you can only define slotted holes for component pins. All pads in the pad stack should be oval or rectangular; the pad shape is checked on the mounted side. You can also create a thermal or antipad definition for slotted holes.

For custom antipads, the default antipad shape around the slotted hole is always oval. For custom thermals, the default pad shape around the slotted hole depends on the pad shape on the specific layer.

For custom thermals, settings on the Pad Stacks Properties Dialog Boxcontrol spoke angle and width. The Clearance Rules dialog boxon page 1167 pad to copper clearance controls the calculation of the outer width.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_34_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Note:**

A custom thermal or antipad for a slotted hole has the same orientation and offset as the slot.

Other information on slotted holes includes:

- Slotted holes are displayed in the same color as drills.
- The Drill Oversize option in the Options dialog box **Design** tab applies to plated slotted holes.
- Drill-to-drill clearance checking checks slotted holes.
- You can use slotted holes as test points.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_34_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** Control the line width for slotted holes using Line Width in the Drill Drawing Options dialog box.

#### Slotted Hole Geometry
The valid range of values for slotted hole length, orientation, and offset parameters are the same as those for a pad. They are expressed in the design units selected in the associated Pad Stacks Properties dialog box.

Length Value Range: >= 0 and <= 1000 mils (25.4 mm)

Orientation Value Range: >= 0.000 and <= 179.999 degrees

<span id="page-35-0"></span>Offset Value Range: >= -500 (-17.2 mm) and <= 500 mils 17.2 (mm)

#### Slotted Hole Offset Versus Pad Offset
You can change the offset of oval pad shapes to move the electrical center of the pin (as well as the center of the drill). Since standard conventions consider slotted holes to be drills, such conventions also consider the electrical center to be the center of the slotted hole.

If you moved the pad offset to the far end of the pad, you would quickly move the slotted hole outside the pad boundary. Instead of moving a pad offset, you can use a slotted hole offset to move the slotted hole.

Slotted hole offset moves the center of the slotted hole relative to the electrical center of the pin–always in the opposite direction of the pad offset. For example, if you want to move the electrical center of a 200x60 mil pad 70 mils to the left, set a pad offset of 70. To center the slotted hole, set a slotted hole offset of 70. See the graphic below for more information. The maximum amount of offset you can set is one half the length.

#### CAM Output and Slotted Holes
The CAM output type determines how slotted holes are defined and represented.

**Drill Drawings**

Slotted holes are shown on drill drawing as 2 drill symbols, one at each end of the centerline of the slotted hole. The true outline (edge-to-edge representation) of the slotted hole is then drawn around the two drill symbols.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_36_Figure_2.jpeg)

Slotted holes are shown in the drill chart as a value in the Size column. The size is the edge-to-edge size of the slotted hole, meaning that the width of the slotted hole is also the drill size. The Quantity column shows the number of slots.

The table below shows a sample Drill chart of a DIP14 with a 30x120 mil plated slotted holes at each end

| SIZE   | QTY | SYM | PLTD |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| 35     | 14  | +   | PLTD |
| 30x132 | 2   | X   | PLTD |

**Table 59. Sample Drill Chart**

**NC Drill**

Two drill symbols for each end of a slotted hole are created in the NC drill data. Slotted holes are output according to pin type output (plated/nonplated). Slotted hole test points are output according to test point output. For example, if you output plated pins and test points, slotted holes that are plated and/or test points will also be output.

**Gerber Output**

Slotted holes are represented two ways in Gerber data. The first is as a centerline with endpoints that are one half the drill size from the ends of the slotted hole. The second ways is as a closed, unfilled oval, showing the outer edge of the slotted hole. The centerline of this oval is the outer edge of the slotted hole. Both are drawn with the smallest round aperture available.

**Figure 17. Gerber Output of Slotted Holes**

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_36_Figure_12.jpeg)

#### Slotted Holes in CAM350
The method of fabrication determines the hole representation you use in CAM350.

- To create slotted holes with a series of drills, use the centerline format and the Gerber to Drill feature in CAM350.
- To mill slotted holes, use the outer edge format and Gerber to Mill in CAM350.

#### Creating Slotted Holes in Decals
You can add slotted holes to a decal in the Decal Editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Setup> Pad Stacks** menu item.
- 3. In the Pad Stacks Properties Dialog Box, set any pad stack options you want, such as plated, size, shape, and layer.
- 4. Select the Slotted check box to add a slotted hole to the decal.
- 5. Set the length, orientation, and offset of the slotted hole.
- 6. Click **OK**.
- 7. Choose whether to keep existing attributes on the pin (Keep Attributes), and then choose whether to apply the pad stack changes to all decal types (All) or to just the selected component (Selected). You can also to cancel the slotted hole creation (Cancel).

#### Creating Slotted Holes in Pins
You can select individual pins on a decal and add slotted holes.

- 1. Select a pin, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. Click **Pad Stack**.
- 3. In the Pad Stacks Properties Dialog Box, select the Slotted check box to add a slotted hole.
- 4. Set the length, orientation, and offset of the slotted hole.
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. Choose whether to keep existing attributes on the pin (Keep Attributes), and then choose whether to apply the pad stack changes to all decal types (All) or to just the selected component (Selected). You can also choose to cancel the slotted hole creation (Cancel).

### Creating Assembly Drawing Decal Objects
SailWind Layout uses the assembly outline and assembly refdes on the assembly drawing to define the exact outline and identify the body of the part. The assembly outline shows where the part is to be placed during the board assembly process.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button then click the **2D line** button and then on the Assembly Drawing Top layer, draw the outline. For more information on drawing 2D shapes, see Creating a Drafting Object.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_38_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** If you flip a part to the other side of the board, the assembly outline flips with it. Even though you create the outline on the Assembly Top layer, it automatically flips to the Assembly Bottom layer when you flip the component from the mounted side to the opposite side.

- 3. Add a second reference designator label on the Assembly Outline Top layer. The reference designator label should be large and located inside the outline. For more comprehensive procedures than what is listed below, see [Creating Attribute Labels in the PCB Decal Editor.](#page-43-1)
	- a. Click **Add New Label** .
	- b. In the Add New Decal Labelon page 1060 dialog box, in the Attribute list, select the Ref.Des. attribute.
	- c. In the Layer list, select the assembly drawing top layer.
	- d. Click **OK**. The label appears with the value "Name".
	- e. Right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
	- f. Position the new label.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_38_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** To create assembly layer reference designators globally in the design editor, see Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings.

**Results**

If a 2D item does not appear after you draw it, the color set for Lines on the layer is probably the same as the background color. Set a different color for Lines in the Display Colors Setup dialog box.on page 1318

### Creating Silkscreen Decal Objects
The silkscreen outline prints on the board and remains visible on the board after the part has been placed. This outline—along with its reference designator, pin number and polarity labels—identifies the part and its pins to anyone assembling, testing, or servicing the board. The silkscreen also serves as a nudge outline if no actual nudge outline exists on Layer 20.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button then click the **2D line** button and then on the Silkscreen Top layer, draw the outline. For more information on drawing 2D shapes, see Creating a Drafting Object.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_39_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** If you flip a part to the other side of the board, the silkscreen outline flips with it. Even though you create the outline on the Silkscreen Top layer, it automatically flips to the Silkscreen Bottom layer when you flip the component from the mounted side to the opposite side.

3. Move the silkscreen refdes to the Silkscreen Top layer. The silkscreen refdes label is automatically added at the creation of the new decal. But by default it is added to the Top (Mounted) layer.

a. Double-click the "Name" label in the decal.

b. In the Decal Label Properties Dialog Box, in the Layer list, select the silkscreen top layer.

- c. Click **OK**.
- 4. Add pin number, and polarity labels if needed. The labels should be located outside the outline, where they can be seen after the part is placed. For more comprehensive procedures than what is listed below, see ["Creating Attribute Labels in the PCB Decal Editor](#page-43-1)".
- 5. Silkscreens for large components with many pins often have miniature dots or pin numbers visible next to selected pins to make it easier locate a pin on the board during testing or troubleshooting sessions. If you use text in the decal for these, they will not be movable when the component is placed in the design. Use labels instead; labels can be moved or deleted in the design if necessary.
	- a. Click **Add New Label**.
	- b. In the Add New Decal Labelon page 1060 dialog box, in the Attribute box, type a name for the new attribute. The value can only be assigned once the decal is used in the design.
	- c. In the Layer list, select the silkscreen top layer.
	- d. Click **OK**. The label appears with the attribute name you typed.
- e. Right-click and click the **Move**. popup menu item.
- f. Position the new placeholder.

**Results**

If an item does not appear after you add it, the color set for the item is probably the same as the background color. Set a different color in the Display Colors Setup dialog box.on page 1318

The refdes (Name label) is controlled by the Pin Num column and the part type (Type label) is controlled by the Type column.

### Creating a Placement (Nudge) Decal Outline
Some parts need additional spacing to allow for machine-placement or rework on the physical board. The placement (or nudge) outline defines these spacings.

The placement (nudge) outline (sometimes called a "courtyard") defines the boundary where nudgingon page 499 of the part initiates when another part is moved against it.

You can use a larger outline on layer 20 to ensure that your design placement is correct even though you apply the same "Body to body" clearance for all components.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button then click the **2D line** button and then on layer 20 (120 in max layers mode), draw the 2D line item(s) defining the nudge outline. For more information on drawing 2D shapes, see Creating a Drafting Object.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_40_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** The outline does not have to be a contiguous shape enclosing the part. It can be made up of multiple 2D items—any object placed on Layer 20 (the Placement layer) is considered part of the "outline".

**Results**

The placement outline is considered by the software as part of the component body. Whenever it is encountered, the "Body to body" clearance rule is invoked.

If a 2D item does not appear after you draw it, the color for Lines on layer 20 is probably the same as the background color. Set a different color for Lines in the Display Colors Setup dialog box.on page 1318

### Importing RF Shapes in DXF Format
You can import specialized shapes of DXF format into your decal or into the design using the AutoCAD 2004 DXF format.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

DXF import only supports the following geometries: POINT, LINE, ARC, CIRCLE, ELLIPS, TRACE, SOLID, 3DFACE, POLYLINE, LWPOLYLINE (AutoCAD R14), and BLOCKS with hierarchy.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button.
- 2. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Import DXF File** button.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_41_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** The DXF import functionality of the Import DXF File button is optimized for importing RF shapes as 2D lines or copper. For more DXF import functionality use the File > Import methodon page 297.

- 3. In the File Import dialog box, browse for the DXF file and then click **Open**.
- 4. In the DXF Import Dialog Box, in the DXF-File Unit list, select the units used in the DXF file.
- 5. For each layer you want to include in the import:
	- a. Select the Add check box.
	- b. In the PCB Layer column, double-click a layer box and select the PCB layer to use for the items of that DXF Layer.
	- c. In the Type column, double-click a type box and select either 2D Line or Copper for the DXF items of that layer.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_41_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:** A PCB layer set to <All Layers> cannot be imported as copper. You cannot have copper items on <All Layers> in a PCB decal.

**6. Click OK.**

**Results**

The geometries are added to the design or the decal in the PCB Decal Editor. If you need your imported geometries to be single objects, but they have been imported as multiple line items, see Join and Close 2D Lines and Copper Shapes.

### Attributes in the PCB Decal Editor
You can add attributes automatically to the Attribute Dictionary when returning from the PCB Decal Editor.

You can use attributes in the PCB Decal Editor, but they differ in concept from attributes in the Layout Editor: The only attributes you can create in the PCB Decal Editor are decal attributes, which are associated with the physical decal.

The Attribute Dictionary does not exist in the PCB Decal Editor; therefore, attributes in the PCB Decal Editor are text strings only. They do not have properties, types, hierarchies, and other settings that attributes in the Attribute Dictionary have.

When you use Edit Decal to enter the PCB Decal Editor (to edit a design decal), upon exit, you are asked whether to apply the changes you made. If you apply the changes when you return to the Layout Editor, any attributes you added in the PCB Decal Editor are added to the Attribute Dictionary. The attributes are added at the Decal level of the attribute hierarchy and assigned to the appropriate objects.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_42_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

When you enter PCB Decal Editor using the Tools menu item (to edit a library decal), any attributes you create in the PCB Decal Editor are not added to the Attribute Dictionary.

If you created an attribute in the PCB Decal Editor that exists in the Attribute Dictionary, the existing attribute in the dictionary is maintained. The attribute is assigned to the part that uses the decal. If a label for the attribute exists, it is associated with the attribute in the Attribute Dictionary.

If you created an attribute in the PCB Decal Editor that does not exist in the Attribute Dictionary, a non ECO-Registered attribute is created with the Free Text type. The attribute is then assigned to the part that uses the decal. If a label for the attribute exists, it is associated with the attribute created in the Attribute Dictionary.

### Creating Attributes in the PCB Decal Editor
You can define attributes for a decal by typing in the desired name or selecting an attribute name from a pre-defined list.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 3. In the Decal Attributes Dialog Box, click **Add**.
- 4. Do one of the following:
	- Type an attribute name in the new Attribute cell, and press the Enter key. Attribute names are not checked in the PCB Decal Editor.
	- Select the new Value cell and click **Edit**.
	- Type an attribute value, and press the Enter key. You can also type units for the value. If you do not specify units, the decal units are used.
- 5. Click **Close**.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_42_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also add attributes using the **Browse Lib. Attr.** button.

**Related Topics**

### Modifying an Attribute
You can use the Attribute Manager to modify an attribute.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Click the **Edit> Attribute Manager** menu item.
- 3. In the Decal Attributes Dialog Box, Select the Attribute cell or the Value cell for the attribute.
- 4. Click **Edit**.
- 5. Type a new name or value, and press the Enter key.
- 6. Click **Close**.

### Creating Attribute Labels in the PCB Decal Editor
Labels in the PCB Decal Editor offer you greater flexibility than labels in the Layout Editor; you can display either decal attributes or an attribute from an object that uses the decal.

Other than the enhanced flexibility, you use attribute labels in the PCB Decal Editor exactly as you use labels in the Layout Editoron page 581.

For example, you can create a label for the part attribute Cost. Since Cost is not a decal attribute, you create the attribute in the Attribute Dictionary in the Layout Editor, and assign a placeholder label in the PCB Decal Editor. For more information, see ["Creating Placeholder Attribute Labels"on page 201](#page-44-0)

When you create labels, they may not be visible. Turn on the visibility of labels using the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box. Here, you can set the color for reference designators, part type, and attribute labels.

**Tip**

Pre-version 3.0 labels for part names, reference designators, and terminal numbers are converted to labels for version 3.0 and higher when you open the part in the Decal Editor.

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. With a decal open, click the **Drafting Toolbar** button to display the Drafting Toolbar.
- 3. Click the **Add New Label** button.
- 4. In the Add New Decal Label Dialog Box, in the Attribute list, select the attribute you want, or if the attribute you desire is not shown in the list, in the Attribute list click <Browse Lib. Attr.> to pick from the list of all library attributes. If you are creating labels for jumpers, Reference Designator is the

only available attribute. Also, hidden attributes do not appear in the Attribute list unless the attribute was selected for the label before it was set as a hidden attribute.

- 5. In the Browse Library Attributes Dialog Boxclick the attribute and click **OK**. The dialog box closes and the attribute name appears in the Attribute list in the Add New Decal Label dialog box.
- 6. The Value box lists the value of the selected attribute. Accept this value, or type a new one. This box is unavailable if you selected Reference Designator or Part Type from the Attribute list, if the attribute is read-only, or if you open the Properties dialog box for labels of different attribute types. However, if the labels you select belong to attributes of the same type, you can edit this box. If the attributes have different values, the box is blank. You can type a new value in the box to apply it to all of the selected attribute labels and their parent objects. Additionally, be aware that Value is also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registered and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.
- 7. In the Show list, select the value you want to control the visibility of the label. You can choose to turn the label off, to display only the label name, to display only the label value, to display the name and value, or to display the full name and value (when labeling a structured attributeon page 1862). Labels are invisible regardless of this setting unless you use the Display Colors Setup dialog box to change the color of labels to a color different from that of the background.
- 8. Complete the label configuration by specifying the desired font, the layer for the label, position, X,Y location, rotation, size, stroke width, mirroring, justification and right reading selections. For more information on the details of these settings, see Add New Decal Label Dialog Box.
- 9. Click **OK**.

**Related Topics**

[Creating Placeholder Attribute Labels](#page-44-0)

### Creating Placeholder Attribute Labels
A *placeholder label* is a label for an attribute that does not exist.

Placeholder labels have two practical uses:

- To predefine label positions in the decal and use them in the Layout Editor. This method also lets you create labels for non-decal attributes.
- To create a label for an attribute that will be created in the Layout Editor, but does not exist yet.

- 1. When you [create a labelon page 200](#page-43-1) in the PCB Decal Editor, in the Add New Decal Label Dialog Box, in the Attribute list, click "New user attr". UserAttribN appears in the Attributes list, where N is 1, 2, 3, or the next available number.
- 2. Type the name of an attribute for which you want to create a label.
- 3. Continue to define the label.
- 4. Once you create a placeholder label, you can easily associate it with an existing attribute in the Attribute Dictionary when you return to the Layout Editor.

### Modifying Decal Label Properties
Use the Decal Label Properties dialog box to modify a decal label or to change the attribute that the label displays.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > PCB Decal Editor** menu item to open the Decal Editor.
- 2. Select a decal labelon page 589, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item. If you select multiple labels, settings in this dialog box apply to all selected labels.
- 3. In the Decal Label Properties Dialog Box, in the Attribute list, select the attribute you want.

If you are creating or modifying labels for jumpers, Reference Designator is the only available attribute.

Hidden attributes do not appear in the Attribute list unless the attribute was selected for the label before it was set as a hidden attribute.

- 4. The Value box lists the value of the selected attribute. Accept this value, or type a new one. This box is unavailable if you clicked Reference Designator or Part Type from the Attribute list, if the attribute is read-only, or if you open the Properties dialog box for labels of different attribute types. However, if the labels you select belong to attributes of the same type, you can edit this box. If the attributes have different values, the box is blank. You can type a new value in the box to apply it to all of the selected attribute labels and their parent objects. Additionally, be aware that Value is also unavailable if the attribute is ECO-registered and SailWind Layout is not in ECO mode.
- 5. In the Show list, click the value you want to control the visibility of the label. You can choose to turn the label off, to display only the label name, to display only the label value, to display the name and value, or to display the full name and value (when labeling a structured attributeon page 1862). Labels are invisible regardless of this setting unless you use the Display Colors Setup dialog box to change the color of labels to a color different from that of the background.
- 6. Complete the label configuration by specifying the desired font, the layer for the label, position, X,Y location, rotation, size, stroke width, mirroring, justification and right reading selections. For more information on the details of these settings, see Decal Label Properties Dialog Box.
- 7. Click **OK**.

**Related Topics**

[Creating Attribute Labels in the PCB Decal Editor](#page-43-1)

### Non-Decal Attributes
A decal label always associates with an attribute name. At any time, that attribute may or may not be a decal attribute.

For example, you may create a decal attribute called My Attribute and then create a label for it. If you delete the decal attribute, the label remains, but it is now associated with a non-decal attribute with the name My Attribute.

The reverse is also true. You can create a label and associate it with an attribute that is not a decal attribute (by choosing an attribute from the Library Attribute Manager or by typing an attribute name in the Add New Decal Label dialog box). The label is now associated with a non-decal attribute.

### Creating Keepout Areas in a Decal
You can create keepouts in the PCB Decal Editor. Decal-level keepouts appear similar to other keepouts. When you create a decal-level keepout, any part using the decal in the Layout Editor uses the specified keepout restrictions.

You can create a decal-level keepout that restricts Trace and Copper, Copper Plane, Via and Jumper, and Test Points. You cannot create keepouts for placement, component height, or component drills. You create a keepout in the PCB Decal Editor the same way you create one in the Layout Editor.

You can create keepout areas using closed polygons (with or without arcs), circles, or rectangles. The current angle mode and design grid settings determine the placement of the lines.

You cannot move a decal-level keepout independently of the part to which it belongs. Once you create a decal-level keepout, you must enter the PCB Decal Editor to modify any properties of the keepout. You modify keepouts in the PCB Decal Editor exactly as you would in the Layout Editor. User interaction is the same for either; the only difference is the type of objects you can restrict.

For more information on creating and modifying keepouts, see the Keepouts on page 465topic.

**Procedure**

- 1. With a decal open in the Decal Editor, click the **Drafting Toolbar** button to open the Drafting Toolbar, and then click the **Keepout** button.
- 2. Right-click and click a draw mode from the popup menu for the type of shape you want to create.
- 3. Create a closed shape to define the keepout area. The Drafting Properties dialog box automatically appears when you close the shape.
- 4. In the Add Drafting Dialog Box, select restrictions. If you select the Placement restriction, it prevents placement of other components. Components bodies are repelled from one another on mounted layers using the clearance distance specified in the Body to Body design ruleon page 1167. In addition, you can create a larger [nudge outlineon page 197](#page-40-0) or courtyard that also applies only to the mounted layer. But a component keepout can be placed on any layer. For example, you create a placement keepout on the opposite side of the board in order to keep the area below free of components. Since the keepout is added to the library decal, it moves with the component in the design.
- 5. Click the layer on which to place the keepout. When you choose layer assignments, restrictions not available for that layer are unavailable. When defining keepouts in the PCB Decal Editor, you can also assign keepouts to the variable <Opposite Side> layer. You cannot do this in the Layout Editor - keepouts are assigned to a specific layer.
- 6. Click **OK**. The keepout is created. If you create other keepouts, they use the restrictions you set here as the default.

**Results**

If you export your design in ASCII format to an older version of the software where Placement keepouts are not valid, you will receive a warning message. If the Placement restriction is the only restriction, the keepout will not be exported. If the Placement restriction was not the only restriction, the keepout will be exported without the Placement restriction.

### Modifying Decal-level Keepouts
After you create a decal-level keepout, you must use the PCB Decal Editor to modify any of its properties. You can change the size of a keepout just as you would any other drafting object: move an edge or corner, or change the diameter of a circle. You can also copy a keepout to another location and change its restrictions or layer assignments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an edge, right-click, and then click the **Select Shape** popup menu item.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. Turn restrictions on or off and modify the layer settings. For more information, see Drafting Object Properties.
- 4. Click **OK**.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_47_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot modify a keepout that is part of a physical design reuse. If you try to, the message "Reuse elements cannot be modified. Break the reuse first" appears. Click **OK** to cancel the operation.

### Layers for Decal-level Keepouts
To create keepouts assigned to Inner Layers (any layer other than top or bottom), you must increase the number of layers to three.

Decal-level keepouts use the same layer assignments as keepouts created in the Layout Editor, plus an additional option for Opposite Layer. Opposite Layer assigns restrictions to the side opposite the one on which you place the component. For example, while editing a decal, create a Copper Plane keepout and choose Opposite Side from the Layer list. In the Layout Editor, and with the component mounted on the top side, the keepout prevents copper planes in that area on the bottom layer. If you click Flip Side to place the component on the bottom layer, the keepout prevents copper planes in that area on the top layer.

### Generating Drafting Shapes from Terminals
You can use the outline of a terminal as the basis to create new drafting shapes.

- 1. Select one or more terminals.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Generate Drafting Shape** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Generate Drafting Shape Dialog Box, select the type of drafting item from the Type list. The valid drafting types are 2D Line, Copper, Copper Cut Out, and Keepout.
- 4. In the Layer list, select the Layer on which to place the new drafting shape.
- 5. In the Width box, type a line width for the new shape.
- 6. In the Oversize/Undersize value box, do one of the following:
	- To create a new drafting shape larger than the terminal outline by the typed value, type a positive number.
	- To create a new drafting shape equal in size to the terminal, type 0 (zero).
	- To create a new drafting shape smaller than the terminal outline by the typed value, type a negative number.
- 7. Click **Complete** to close the dialog box and create a new shape or click **Create** to keep the dialog box open for creating more shapes.

### Step and Repeat
The Step and Repeat tool found in the PCB Decal Editor defines complex, repetitive array patterns so that the fanout of traces from a component on a Device Under Test PCB is consistent. Such consistency ensures device simulation and testing takes place under exacting conditions.

Step and Repeat arranges terminal, drawing, copper, cutout, or text items in a planar or polar array pattern. You can replicate single or multiple items.

Step and Repeat also automatically increments repeated terminals and text suffixes.

**Linear Step and Repeat**

Use the Step and Repeat dialog box to create linear arrays.

## Solder and Paste Masks
You can create custom openings in the top and bottom solder mask and paste mask layers for individual pad stacks, for decals, or for components. You do this in the Decal Editor, or in the pad stack.

[Control of Solder Mask and Paste Mask](#page-52-1) [Solder Mask Openings in the Decal Editor](#page-55-0) [Creating Solder Mask Openings in the Pad Stack](#page-56-0) [Paste Mask Openings in the Decal Editor](#page-57-0) [Creating Paste Mask Openings in the Pad Stack](#page-58-1)

### Control of Solder Mask and Paste Mask
You can use several methods to control solder or paste mask openings in the gerber outputs. You can add physical shapes as openings on the mask layers and you can also generate the openings when creating the gerber outputs. Since different areas can have multiple values, the precedence of these values follow a hierarchical rule. You can use any combination of such methods.

**Physical Shapes in the Work Area**

When you create a physical shape (opening) on the mask layer using the following methods, you can view it in the Decal Editor and the Design Editor.

**In the Pad Stacks**

You can add the solder and/or paste mask layer to a pad stack and create the shape and size of the opening. And since you can create all of a component's pins at the same time, you can potentially add mask openings to all the pins of a component at once. This method limits you to the pad shapes that are available to pad stacks.

You can do this at the design level to make it design specific, or at the library level to make it available for each new design that uses the decal.

**In the Decal Editor**

When you edit the decal in the Decal Editor, you can add a copper shape to a solder mask or paste mask layer and that shape becomes the opening in the mask. There are two ways to create the shape:

• You can draw the shape freehand using copper. There is no limit to the shape like in the pad stacks.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_52_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** Use this method to create gang solder mask relief by drawing a copper rectangle over a whole row of pads.

• You can use the Generate Drafting Shape command to generate a copper shape based on the shape of a terminal that you can add to the solder or paste mask layer. This has the same effect as adding the shape to the pad stack.

**Generated Shapes in the CAM Output**

When you generate these shapes in the CAM Output you cannot view them in either the Decal Editor or the Design Editor. They are only visible in the CAM Preview.

**In the CAM Output**

When you create the solder or paste mask output, you can add the pads (from the component layer) and the pad shapes become the mask openings. You can globally oversize or undersize the pad shapes with a setting in the Plot Options.

**In an Attribute**

You can apply a unique over or under size setting to special components using an attribute. You can assign an oversize or undersize by adding the "CAM.Solder mask.Adjust" or "CAM.Paste mask.Adjust" attribute to a decal. The attribute value applies to all pads of the component.

**Mask Hierarchy**

There is a hierarchical order to the solder mask and paste mask values when there are conflicts. When multiple values exist at different hierarchy levels, the highest priority value is used; the others are ignored.

The following table content is true only while the CAM.Apply Oversize To All Pads attribute on page 960 is set to Yes (the default setting on all new designs in PADS 2007.1 and later versions).

## Updating a Design from the Library
When you import a netlist into a design, SailWind Layout writes a copy of the library content for the parts into the design. Over time, however, as you make updates to the library, the parts in the design fall out of synchronization with newer versions in the library.

Use Update from Library (UFL) to create a report of any part differences between the current design and the library, and to update the design to reflect the current state of the library. You can compare or update:

- Part types
- PCB decals and decal rules
- Attributes and labels

**Restrictions and Limitations**

When updating a design from the Library, these restrictions will apply:

- Since each item in your design is linked to its library counterpart by name only, unconsidered updating can have unforeseen and unintended consequences. Before you update any design, you should always ascertain how updating will affect it. Either generate a comparison report and determine what differences exist between the design and library (and thus what changes will occur during the update,) or make a copy of the design and check/test the updated copy for unwanted changes or behavior.
- To find differences between the library and design in the comparison report, search for "different".
- Design changes resulting from updating can cause existing electrical nets to be truncated, split, or deleted altogether. It can also cause existing electrical nets to be extended, or new electrical nets to be created if the refdes prefixes of updated components are specified in the Electrical Nets dialog box. For more information, see "Electrical Nets"on page 337.

**Procedure**

- 1. Verify that the library order is correct. Updating from the library searches libraries for part types using the library order shown in the "Library List dialog box"on page 1448.
- 2. If you want to compare/update only specific components, select them. Otherwise, the update from library process selects all components in the design by default.
- 3. Click the **Tools > Update from Library** menu item.
- 4. Modify the settings in the Update from Library Dialog Box.
- 5. Click **OK**.

When the comparison or update operation is completed, the update report is opened for viewing, and a link to the report file is written to the Output Window.

[Undo an Update From Library](#page-60-0)

[Prevention](#page-60-1) of Update From Library Undo Buffer Overruns

## Undo an Update From Library
If an update operation updates at least one item, the update process creates an undo checkpoint so that you can undo any changes made to the design. You can revert to the last-saved checkpoint using the **Edit> Undo** menu item.

![](/layout/guide/7/_page_60_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** If nothing updates, the update from library process does not create a new undo checkpoint and preserves undo data and undo checkpoints created by previous commands.

## Prevention of Update From Library Undo Buffer Overruns
SailWind Layout stores the data required to undo an update in the *undo buffer*.

To prevent overflows of this buffer when updating very large designs, UFL estimates the amount of undo data being generated, and if there is risk of a buffer overflow, displays this prompt:

"Too much data to fit into the Undo buffer. The Undo buffer will be cleared. Continue?"

Respond with one of the following actions:

- Click **OK** to clear the undo buffer and disable undo creation for this update. The update operation will continue, and you will be unable to undo the updates.
- Click **Cancel** to cancel the update and return to the UFL dialog. Undo data and undo checkpoints created by previous commands are preserved.

[The Compare/Update Process](#page-60-2)

Update from Library Dialog Box

[How to Read the Update Report](#page-64-0)

## The Compare/Update Process
The update process begins by comparing the design content with the library content. If it finds the design content to be different from the library content, it updates the design content according to the options set in the Update From Library dialog box, and documents the results in the report file. The compare process is the same, except that the design is not updated.

**General Rules**

During Compare/Update, the system will enforce a number of general rules to assure proper execution of the process.

In comparing and updating, the following general rules apply for all items:

- **Matching items**  For each part type and decal listed in the Design items area of the Update from Library dialog box, all available libraries are searched to find a matching named entry, and the first matching entry found is used. Libraries are searched in the order shown in the Library List dialog box (**File> Library> Manage Lib. List** button). You can use this dialog box to change the search order. Libraries that have the Allow Search property turned off are ignored. If no match is found, comparison of the item is skipped, and a "not found" entry is made in the report file.
- **Timestamps** Each part type and decal in the design and library has a timestamp. Depending on the options chosen in the Update from Library dialog box, comparison of the timestamps can determine what is compared/updated. See Update from Library Dialog Box. Designs created with SailWind Layout versions prior to 9.1 do not have timestamps. See [Older Designs](#page-63-0)for information on how to handle these designs.

**What is Compared**

During the Compare/Update process, a number of parameters related to the Part Types and the PCB Decal constructions are compared.

The following tables list the content compared and reported for each item selected for comparison or update.

| Item or Element        | What is Compared & Reported                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Older Designs**

Designs created with PADS Layout versions prior to 9.1 do not have timestamps. This is important to consider when working with older designs.

When one of these designs is opened, the timestamps on all part types and decals in the design are set to "Jan 01 00:00:00 1970" (UTC). To find out whether the content of the part types and decals in the design is in sync with the library, compare the design and library with the Hide identical results check box selected.

**Related Topics**

[Updating a Design from the Library](#page-58-0)

Update from Library Dialog Box

[How to Read the Update Report](#page-64-0)

## How to Read the Update Report
Every time you update a design from the library or generate a comparison report, SailWind Layout writes the results of the operation to a new *UpdateFromLibrary\_Layout\_Report.txt* file in *C:\SailWind Projects*.

The Update Report gives you information about the items selected for comparison or update, including:

- Whether the timestamp of an item in the design is older, newer, or the same as the item's timestamp in the library.
- Whether the content of an item in the design is the same as or different from the item's content in the library.
- The differences between the compared items.

**Update Report Examples**

The Update Report is divided into a header and six sections: Report Options, Results Summary, Part Types Summary, PCB Decals Summary, Part Type Comparison Details, and PCB Decal Comparison Details.

Examples of each section are given in the following figures:

• **Report Options section** — Lists the options selected for this operation in the Update from Library dialog box. Example:

• **Results Summary section** — Gives a statistical summary of comparison and update results. Example:

| RESULTS SUMMARY      |    |  |
