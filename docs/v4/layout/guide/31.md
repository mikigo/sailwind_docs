# Chapter 31 Copper Plane Operations
A *copper plane* is a closed, non-self-intersecting polygon that provides access to universally necessary nets, like power and ground. One design may use several copper planes. Most PCB designs locate planes on inner layers that are dedicated to the plane only, although you can place them on outer layers. The plane area can occupy all or part of the layer it is on. Two or more partial planes can occupy one layer, each servicing a different net. Such a configuration is called a *split plane*.

Copper planes may have insulated traces and vias passing across the plane area, as long as the traces do not divide the plane to break connectivity.

You can create plane areas [manuallyon page 667](#page-0-0) using the drafting tools or [automaticallyon](#page-1-0) [page 668](#page-1-0) using Create Copper Plane, using the board outline as a guide. After identifying a layer as a split/mixed plane layer and assigning nets to the layer, you can add plane areas.

For more information, see "Differences Between Copper Shapes and Copper Planes" on page 779, and ["Split/Mixed Plane Layers"on page 683.](#page-16-0)

The following topics describe the methods used to create copper planes and how to assign nets to them. They also provide detailed information related to copper plane filling, splitting plane areas, thermal connectivity and troubleshooting.

## Creating a Copper Plane Manually
Use a copper plane to create a copper area that avoids objects not connected to its associated net while simultaneously making thermal connections to objects that are connected to its associated net.

Flooded copper planes create automatic clearance to traces, pins, and other objects that do not share the same net assignment.

For more information, see "Differences Between Copper Shapes and Copper Planes" on page 779.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper Plane** button.
- 2. Right-click and click a command to change the values of the drafting object. For more information, see "Set Values Before Creating a Drafting Object".
- 3. Create the shape using one of the following:
	- Creating a Circle Drafting Object
	- Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object
	- Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object
- 4. In the Add Drafting properties dialog box on page 1328that displays:
	- a. Assign a net by selecting the net name in the Net list; or you can click the **Assign Net by Click**  button and click a design object attached to the net.

When you create a copper plane on a split/mixed layer, you can select the "Show plane nets only" check box to limit the nets to only those assigned to the split/mixed plane layer in the Layers Setup.

- b. Make any other appropriate changes to the copper plane properties.
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. View the resulting shape.
	- If the gap between the pad and the copper for thermals or antipads is incorrect, see ["Customizing Design Rule Thermals"on page 669](#page-2-0) or ["Customizing Design Rule Antipads"on](#page-3-0) [page 670](#page-3-0).
	- If the shape edges are not correct, see "Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615".
	- If the shape needs to be modified, see "Drafting Object Properties".
	- If you want to start over, see "Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object".

Flooding Copper Planes

## Creating a Copper Plane Automatically
You can create a copper plane by copying the shape of the board outline. A shape is generated proportionally smaller than the outline and includes miters or small notches existing in the board outline.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, set the active layer to either a non plane layer or a Split/Mixed plane layer in the Layer list.
- 2. Select the board outline.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Create Copper Plane** popup menu item.
- 4. In the Add Drafting dialog box, in the Net assignment area, assign a net to the copper plane using either the net dropdown list or the **Assign Net by Click** button.

You can use the Show plane nets only check box to reduce the list of nets to only those assigned to the layer in the Layers Setup. You can also choose "None" from the dropdown list and associate a net later. If only None appears in the list, the net has not been assigned to the Split/Mixed plane layer in the Layers Setup. When you assign the net to the copper plane, pads associated with these nets will get thermal indicators if they are inside the appropriate polygons.

**Tip** When you use Create Copper Plane, you may receive an error message indicating a self-intersecting polygonon page 625. This occurs because the generated plane area is proportionally smaller than the board outline and the software cannot create small miters and/or notches in the board outline using the specified line width. Correct this error by reducing the distance between the board outline and the plane. In the **Tools > Options** (menu item, **Copper Planes** category, **Hatch and Flood** subcategory, type a smaller value for the Auto Separate Gap setting. Alternatively, you can use a smaller line width for the copper plane (if you choose this method, you also need to reduce the copper hatch grid to match in order to maintain a solid fill for the copper plane. Generating more fill lines consumes more memory and could slow operations if the line width is greatly reduced).

Flooding Copper Planes

## Customizing Design Rule Thermals
You can customize the default thermals on pins, virtual pins, and vias within copper planes. The default thermals depend upon the Thermals options for spoke settings and the Copper-to-Pad or Copper-to-Via clearance rule value for the clearance between the pin pad or via pad and the copper.

**Procedure**

1. Choose the **Tools > Options** menu item and then select the **Copper Planes** category, then **Thermals** subcategory to view the Thermals optionson page 1514.

There are separate settings for Drilled (Through-hole) and SMT (surface mount) pads.

- 2. Set the width of the spokes in the Spoke width box.
- 3. Set the minimum allowed number of spokes in the Spoke minimum box.
- 4. For each pad shape, set the orientation of the spokes.

**Tip**

If you only want to flood over vias, you can enable an option in the properties of the copper plane. see "Flood and Hatch Options Dialog Box" for the "Flood over vias" check box.

- 5. If you want to allow routed pads to also have thermal connections, select the "Add thermals to routed component pads" check box.
- 6. Open the Design Ruleson page 1674. In any applicable level of the hierarchy of the design rules, in the Clearanceon page 1167 rules, set the Copper-to-Pad and Copper-to-Via value according to the needs of your design.

**Results**

- After you fill the copper plane, a*therm.err* report generates if any pads receive fewer spokes than the Min. spoke value. For example, if the pad intersects the boundary of a copper plane, it may not be possible to create all four spokes.
- After filling a copper plane, if any pad fails to receive a thermal, use the Selection Filter to check for trace stubs at the pad. Small leftover trace segments attached to a pad prevent the pad from receiving thermals if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" check box is selected (in the Options dialog box, **Copper Planes** category, **Thermals** subcategory). Set the Selection Filter to Traces, Corners, and Tacks to select and remove trace segments attached to the pad.

## Customizing Design Rule Antipads
You can customize the default antipads that appear around pins, vias, or drill holes within copper planes. Default antipads depend upon the Copper-to-Pad, Copper-to-Via, or Copper-to-Drill clearance rule value for the clearance between the pin pad, via pad, or drill hole and the copper. You can apply the clearance value to either the net of the copper plane or the net of the pad/via.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Design Rules** menu item.
- 2. In the Design Ruleson page 1674 dialog box, in any applicable level of the hierarchy of the design rules, in the Clearanceon page 1167 rules, set the Copper-to-Pad, Copper-to-Via, and Copper-to-Drill values according to the needs of your design.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_3_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** By applying the clearance to the net of the copper plane rather than the pads, you can affect all pads, vias, and drills within the copper plane. But by applying the clearance to the net of pads and vias rather than the copper plane, you can achieve different antipad spacings. Or you can use a combination - apply a general minimum clearance to the net of the copper plane and apply a larger clearance to nets of objects that need larger antipads.

**Results**

- When you are dealing with antipads, there are two nets involved. If you are not getting the results you expect, ensure that the clearance values of the other net involved are not conflicting with the values you have already changed. Larger clearance values always have precedence.
- With through hole pins and vias, the copper-to-drill value applies if the "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" check box is selected.
- The **Tools > Options** (menu item), **Copper Planes** (category), **Thermals** (subcategory) option "Remove unused pads" and "Use design rules for thermals and antipads" both affect the clearance of the antipad.

## Associating a Net to a Copper Plane
You can associate a net with a copper plane at any point in the design process. This allows you the flexibility to assign a net to a copper plane at the time of creation, or to create the copper plane and then go back at some future time and associate a particular net with the copper plane.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the copper plane outline.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. Click a net from the **Net** list.
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Examples**

Use the Drafting Properties dialog box to associate a net to a copper plane if:

- You created a copper plane before you assigned nets to the copper plane in the Layer Setup dialog box.
- You chose None from the Assign Net to Selected Polygon dialog box when you split a copper plane.
- You want to associate a different net to a copper plane.

## Assigning Nets to Split/Mixed Plane Layers
After defining your plane layers, you can assign the appropriate net(s) to those layers to establish the desired connectivity in the design.

Use Assign Nets in the Layers Setup Dialog Box to assign one or more nets to the split/mixed plane layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Layer Definition** menu item.
- 2. Select a split/mixed plane layer and click the **Assign Nets** button.
- 3. Select a net from the All Nets list.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_5_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:** You can assign a net to as many layers as required.

- 4. Click **Add** to move the net to the Assigned Nets list box.
- 5. Repeat the steps above to associate additional nets.
- 6. Click **OK** to close the Plane Layer Nets dialog box.
- 7. Click **OK** to close the Layer Setup dialog box.

## Control the Display of Thermals in Copper Planes
Use the Options dialog box > **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals** subcategory to control the display of thermal information.

For more information, see "[Assigning Copper Plane Thermal Attributes](#page-21-0)."

Use the "Active Layer Comes to Front" check box in the **Tools > Options** (menu item), **Global** (category), Generalon page 1531 subcategory to view more detail for the thermal and antipad clearances. When this check box is selected, a small outline in the shape of the pad or via is visible when the current layer is a split/mixed plane layer. If the thermal display properties are correctly set, thermal graphics appear at all pins and vias belonging to the copper plane net.

## System-prompted Copper Plane Filling
When you use certain command operations, you are prompted to fill a copper plane. The fill prompts appear when you verify your design or run CAM generation commands.

**Verify Design**

When you use the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item, and you perform a Copper Plane check (and also select the "Check clearance and connectivity" option in the Setup), the software checks for proper setup, creates the copper plane (if only one net is assigned), if necessary. The software then prompts you to fill the copper plane automatically. For more information, see "Verify the Design."

**Run CAM**

When you run CAM on a split/mixed plane layer, the software checks for proper setup and creates the copper plane if necessary. The software then prompts you to fill the copper plane automatically. For more information, see "Creating All Outputs."

## Troubleshooting Copper Plane Fills
Copper plane fills require special attention to assure that the connectivity matches the design intent.

**Solution**

The following situations can prevent a copper plane from filling.

**No pads of the net are located within the copper plane**

Ensure that at least one pad of the net assigned to the copper plane is within the shape.

**No drilled pads are located within the copper plane**

Typically, the default for non-drilled pads is to not have the Plane Thermal property enabled. Enable the Plane Thermal property for non-drilled pads to allow them to connect to the copper plane with thermals. Select the pad(s), right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Pin Properties Dialog Box, select the Plane Thermal check box. This causes the system to re-check which pins should get plane thermals based on the layers and nets.

**No pads or vias located within the copper plane have the Plane Thermal property enabled**

Enable the Plane Thermal property for pads and vias to allow them to connect to the copper plane with thermals. Select the pad(s), right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Pin Properties Dialog Box, select the Plane Thermal check box. This causes the system to re-check which pins and vias should get plane thermals based on the layers and nets. Repeat the process for the via(s).

**No copper plane is defined**

Ensure you can see the outline of the copper plane.

**Multiple copper planes are intersecting or defined on top of each other**

One of the copper planes must take priority and you must create a cutout of the other plane. You might benefit from enabling the "Create cutouts around embedded copper planes" option found by choosing the **Tools > Options** menu item, Copper Planes (category), "Hatch and Flood"on page 1511 subcategory. For information about giving a copper plane a flood priority, see the Flood Priority setting in the "Flood and Hatch Options Dialog Box". The Flood Priority numbers should be lowest for inner nested copper planes and greatest for the outer copper planes.

**You have modified the copper plane outline while the copper plane area is filled**

Return the plane area to the basic plane outline using the modeless command PO before modifying the shape of the outline.

**You have embedded/nested copper planes**

You must create the largest copper plane first, then the smaller inner copper plane(s) next. (As long as you select the **Tools > Options** menu item, then **Copper Planes** (category), **Hatch and Flood**  (subcategory), then "Create cutouts around embedded copper planes" check box, this automatically assigns the correct flood priority and creates the required copper plane cutout within the larger split plane.)

If you neglected to select the "Create cutouts around embedded copper planes" option or you simply created the inner copper plane area first, the copper plane areas have conflicting flood priority values and are unable to fill. You must decide the order in which the copper planes should be filled and adjust their flood priorities accordingly. For information about giving a copper plane a flood priority, see the Flood Priority setting in the "Flood and Hatch Options dialogon page 1381" box. If you have only one inner copper plane, there is a quicker way to give it the higher flood priority. Use the PO modeless command to return the plane to outline mode. Select the plane area shape, right-click and click the **Bring to Front**  popup menu item. The system recognizes the new flood priority and fills the copper plane.

**Traces or pins block the fill from connecting with any pads of the same net**

You must free up space for the fill at the current width and grid setting to flow and contact at least one pad of the same net with thermals.

**Your minimum hatch area setting is too large**

In the **Tools > Options** (menu item), **Copper Planes** (category), "Hatch and Flood"on page 1511 subcategory, check the "Min. Hatch Area" and ensure the value entered is not larger than the copper plane size.

**Your keepout is restricting the copper plane**

Assign a color to Keepouts for all layers and ensure they do not restrict copper planes for the location and layer.

**You have hidden the fill**

Ensure the fill is visible. **Tools > Options** (menu item), **Copper Planes** (category), "Hatch and Flood"on page 1511 subcategory, in the Hatch View area, click Normal instead of No Hatch.

**You have set Thermal options to no connect**

Ensure that drilled and non-drilled pads have orthogonal, diagonal, or flood over settings in the Thermals Optionson page 1514.

**You have already routed to all available pads of the same net located within the plane area**

If nets of the same name as the pour or plane are already routed, ensure that the Add thermals to routed component pads check box is selected in the Thermals Optionson page 1514.

## Troubleshooting Thermal Results
When you fill (flood/pour) a copper plane, a Thermal Relief Errors Report (*therm.err*) might appear in your default text editor. This file appears when pads within the copper plane do not receive the

minimum number of spokes according to your settings in the **Tools > Options** menu item, Copper Planes (category), Thermals (subcategory).

**The Thermal Relief Errors Report**

Report sections state whether there is less than 100% or even 50% thermal extensions. Below each section there is a listing of the reference designator with pin number (if a component pad), pad coordinate location and the actual number of thermal spokes that were generated.

For example:

```
Drilled pads with
less than 50% thermal extensions
Report of Thermal Spokes Generator
On Primary Component Side:
J1.5 (455, 650) # = 2
```
This indicates that pin 5 of reference designator J1, at coordinates 455, 650 has only 2 thermal spokes that were generated. The required thermal spokes for this would be 4 or more. There could be a variety of reasons why the number of thermal spokes is reduced such as a clearance issue where as a trace is too close to a pad, or the copper plane outline width and hatch grid are too large for the copper to flood between the component pins, etc.

**Interpreting Thermal Results**

You can interpret the thermal results to detect problematic thermal issues in your design.

If results are not as expected, consider the following:

- If a large number of pads and/or vias have zero thermal spokes being generated, there may be a copper plane that is not filling. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting](#page-7-0) Copper Plane Fills".
- If there are only a few pads or vias that have zero thermal spokes and yet there is no obvious obstruction to their creation, you might have a situation where those pads or vias do not have the Plane Thermal property enabled. Enable the Plane Thermal property for those pads and vias to allow them to connect to the copper plane with thermals. Select the pad(s), right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item. In the Pin Properties dialog box, select the Plane Thermal check box. This causes the system to re-check which pins and vias should get plane thermals based on the layers and nets. Repeat the process for the via(s).

## Clearances Between Copper Planes and the Board Outline
A number of factors can influence the way you construct copper planes and how they relate to other objects in a design.

**Plane Edge Setback**

For any plane area, it is desirable for the edge of the flooded plane to be set back slightly from the edge of the board. This prevents the edge of the plane from being exposed during the board trimming process and eliminates the potential of the plane being accidentally shorted to another design or packaging object. There are two important measurements that you must consider when auto-generating a plane area:

- The distance between the board outline and the plane area outline
- The distance between the board outline and the copper within the plane area after flooding (hatch outline)

**Board Outline**

A drawn 2D line represents the board outline. The Default Width setting on the **Text and Lines** category of the Options dialog box determines the width of the line at the time of generation. You can change the board outline width by selecting the board outline and changing the width in the Drafting Properties dialog box.

The line used to represent the board outline is intended to be a visual reference that indicates the perimeter of the board in the design workspace as well as on the CAM plots. Changing the width of this line does not change the dimensions of the board as the actual board edge is at the centerline of this 2D line.

**Plane Area Pour Outline**

You can create a plane area by defining its pour outline. When you create the plane area pour outline, you specify the width of the line that represents the visible boundaries of the shape. The outer edge of this outline represents the maximum extents of the copper when the shape is flooded. The Board to Copper clearance rule influences how the design references the edges of this shape and can modify the extents of the copper flooding when required.

For more information on how plane area pour outlines are created, see Edge Precision of Drafting Shapeson page 615.

**Auto Separate Gap**

You can split a single plane area shape into two or more shapes. When you divide the plane area, you can control the desired spacing between these multiple plane area shapes by specifying a value for the Auto Separate Gap (choose the **Tools > Options** menu item and click the **Copper Planes** category > **Hatch and Flood** subcategory to access this setting).

The lines used to create the plane area pour outlines are Drafting objects and have width. If you have specified a value for the Auto Separate Gap, this value is used to compute the distance between the edges of these lines. Therefore, if you specify a 25 mil value for the Auto Separate Gap, the plane area pour outlines will be separated from one another by a distance of 25 mils. This distance is measured between the outer edges of the lines used to draw the plane area shapes.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 81. Auto Separate Gap**

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_11_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

When multiple plane areas exist on the same layer, the flood priority assignments determine the final separation gap (see Flood Priority Settings).

When auto-generating plane areas using the board outline shape, the Auto Separate Gap is considered during the calculations used to determine the distance that a plane area will be set back from the edge of the board.

**Restriction:**

If a value of 0 is specified for the Auto Separate Gap, a non-editable system default value of 10 mils is used in this calculation.

For additional information on how split planes are created, see ["Split/Mixed Plane Layers"on page 683](#page-16-0).

**Plane Area Pour Outline Setback from the Board Outline**

The line that draws the board outline is a Drafting object and thus it has a width, so any plane areas sharing a boundary with the board outline use the Auto Separate Gap value to determine the minimum distance that they must pull back from the board edge.

This setback distance is measured from the inside edge of the line used to draw the board outline. Since the board edge is at the center of the line defining the board outline, half of this line width is inside the edge of the board, so the resulting plane area pour outline setback distance is the sum of the value specified in the Auto Separate Gap plus one half of the line width used to draw the board outline.

**Example:** If the board outline width is 10 mils and the Auto Separate Gap is set to 25 mils, then the resulting plane area pour outline setback distance would be the Auto Separate Gap value (25 mils) plus half of the line width value (5 mils) for a total distance of 30 mils from the board edge.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 82. Plane Area Pour Outline Setback from the Board Outline**

**Exception Example:** If no value is specified for the Auto Separate Gap, the system uses the system default value and places the plane area pour outline 10 mils from the inside edge of the line used to draw the board outline, so the resulting plane area pour outline setback distance would be the system default value (10 mils) plus half of the line width value (5 mils) for a total distance of 15 mils from the board edge.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_12_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Plane Flood Hatch Outline Setback From the Board Outline**

When plane areas are in proximity to the board edge, the Board to Copper clearance value in the design rules normally controls the plane flood hatch outline setback. However, if the results of the calculation that determines the plane area pour outline setback has a value larger than the Board to Copper design rule, it takes precedence.

Plane areas are flooded based upon the following conditions:

- 1. If the Board to Copper value is larger than the Auto Separate Gap + half the board outline width, then the plane flooding boundary (hatch outline) is pulled back and the copper flood is set back from the board edge to a distance equal to the Board to Copper Clearance value.
- 2. If the value set in the Board to Copper Clearance is equal to or smaller than the Auto Separate Gap + half the board outline line width, then the plane flooding boundary is not reduced and the area is flooded to the existing plane shape edge.

For additional information related to how the plane flood hatch outlines are filled, see "The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes"on page 617

**Examples of Plane Flooding Setback from the Board Outline**

SailWind Layout calculates plane flooding setback distances based upon various design conditions. The following table provides examples of how plane flooding setback distance is calculated.

| Parameter                 | Example A | Example B | Example C | Example D |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Board Outline Width       | 10 mils   | 10 mils   | 10 mils   | 10 mils   |
| Auto Separate Gap         | 25 mils   | 0         | 25 mils   | 0         |
| Board to Copper           | 50 mils   | 50 mils   | 0         | 0         |
| Results                   |           |           |           |           |
| Distance to Pour Outline  | 30 mils   | 15 mils   | 30 mils   | 15 mils   |
| Distance to Hatch Outline | 50 mils   | 50 mils   | 30 mils   | 15 mils   |

**Table 110. Example Data for Determining Plane Flooding Setback Distance**

**Example A**

The Board to Copper value is greater than the calculated plane area pour outline setback, so the Board to Copper value is used for the hatch outline setback.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_14_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 84. Plane Setback Example A**

**Example B**

The Board to Copper value is greater than the calculated plane area pour outline setback (using the Auto-Separate Gap default value), so the Board to Copper value is used for the hatch outline setback.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_14_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 85. Plane Setback Example B**

**Example C**

The Board to Copper value is equal to or smaller than the calculated plane area pour outline setback, so the plane area pour outline setback value is used for the hatch outline setback (coincident with the pour outline).

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Example D**

The Board to Copper value is greater than the calculated plane area pour outline setback (using the Auto-Separate Gap default value), so the Board to Copper value is used is used for the hatch outline setback.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 87. Plane Setback Example D**

**CAUTION:**

As the flooding operation can reduce the actual flooded area, always check plane connectivity after the flooding operation to be sure there are no discontinuities or starved thermals.

## Split/Mixed Plane Layers
SailWind Layout supports the creation of split and mixed plane layers. A split plane layer is a plane layer with one or more isolated areas of copper that have different net assignments. A mixed plane layer is a plane layer with one or more copper planes and any number of signal routes.

In many designs it is common to require large copper areas for voltage and ground nets. To do this, create an internal layer dedicated to a single net (typically power or ground nets). Although it is common to have one plane layer dedicated to a single net, designs with multiple voltage requirements require you to separate, or split, the plane layer into isolated areas. When designing very dense designs, you can use split/mixed plane layers for normal signal routing.

**Setup> Layer Definition** menu item includes an option for identifying split/mixed plane layers and the 2-D drafting commands contain options for creating closed shapes to define copper planes and voids (areas with no copper). When you route on a layer identified as a split/mixed plane layer, clearances are automatically created around the trace and pin pair: the traces are actually plowed through the copper plane.

Copper plane operations also take full advantage of design rule-driven spacing and thermal relief generation. When you create copper planes with embedded traces, their spacing can be based on custom thermal clearances, design rule clearances or global clearances.

If you use split/mixed planes and you also route using SPECCTRA, see "SPECCTRA and Split/Mixed Planes".

## Creation of Split Planes
You can create more than one copper plane on a split/mixed plane layer.

There are three recommended methods to split a plane layer:

- **Creating Multiple Copper Planes**  For more information, see ["Creating a Copper Plane](#page-0-0) [Manually"on page 667,](#page-0-0) and ["Creating a Copper Plane Automatically"on page 668](#page-1-0).
- **Separating Copper Planes Automatically**  Use the Auto Plane Separate tool to split a copper plane that covers the whole layer or a large area into two or more copper planes. For more information, see ["Separating Copper Planes Automatically"on page 683.](#page-16-2)
- **Creating an Embedded Copper Plane**  Embed a copper plane within another copper plane. For more information, see ["Embedded Copper Planes"on page 685.](#page-18-0)

## Separating Copper Planes Automatically
Use the **Auto Separate** button to divide a copper plane into two new copper planes. Using Auto Separate, you draw a path from one side of a copper plane to another side of the same plane. This path defines the center of the separation between the two new copper planes and divides the copper plane into two distinct shapes.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• You must start and end the separation on the same copper plane polygon.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Standard Toolbar, in the Layer list, click the split/mixed plane layer.
- 2. Use one of the following:
	- For object mode, right-click and click the **Select Anything** popup menu item. Click the starting point of the split on a segment of the copper plane. Right-click and click **Auto Separate**.
	- For verb mode, on the Standard Toolbar, click the **Drafting Toolbar** button. On the Drafting toolbar, click the **Auto Copper Plane Separate** button. Click to indicate a starting location somewhere on the perimeter of the copper plane polygon.
- 3. Double-click at the ending point on the copper plane outline to complete the Auto Separate command.

The Assign Net to Selected Polygon dialog box displays and automatically selects one of the new copper planes. The netnames that appear in the dialog are those that were assigned to the Split/ Mixed layer in the Layers Setup.

4. From the Choose Existing Net area, click a net to assign to the selected copper plane.

This assigns the net, deselects the copper plane, and selects the other copper plane.

**Tip** No segments of the auto-separate path may be outside of the polygon or the message "All segments must be within the copper plane polygon" appears.

5. Click a net for the other copper plane. This assigns the net, deselects the copper plane and closes the dialog box.

**Tip** Use the **Tools > Options** (menu item), Copper Planes (category), Hatch and Floodon page 1511 (subcategory), Auto Separate Gap option to define the distance between the two copper planes.

6. If the message "Can't shrink polygon #1" or "Can't shrink polygon #2" appears, reduce each of the new polygons by one-half of the line width. An error occurred during this operation (probably selfintersection).

## Embedded Copper Planes
Embedded copper planes enable you to create multiple copper planes on a specific layer and control how their constructions interact with each other.

You can embed copper planes (create a copper plane within another copper plane) using one of the following methods:

[Creating an Embedded Copper Plane from the Outermost to the Innermost Area](#page-18-1) [Creating an Embedded Copper Plane by Prioritizing, Adding Cut Outs and Combining](#page-18-2)

### Creating an Embedded Copper Plane from the Outermost to the Innermost Area
When creating an embedded copper plane, work from the outermost area to the innermost area to ensure that all areas flood as expected.

**Procedure**

- 1. Create the outermost copper plane by drawing a copper plane as described in "[Creating a Copper](#page-0-0) [Plane Manually](#page-0-0)," and "[Creating a Copper Plane Automatically](#page-1-0)."
- 2. Create the inner copper plane using the **Copper Plane** button on the Drafting Toolbar.
- 3. Continue nesting copper planes until you define all the embedded copper planes for the layer.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_18_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** The embedded copper planes are automatically brought to the front so they are flooded correctly. To assign different flood priorities, see the "Flood and Hatch Options Dialog Box.

### Creating an Embedded Copper Plane by Prioritizing, Adding Cut Outs and Combining
You cannot ensure correct flooding if you draw the innermost copper planes before the outermost copper planes. To ensure proper flooding of embedded copper planes, you can perform one of two methods: You can change the flooding priority of the embedded copper plane, or you can create a copper plane cut out around the perimeter of an embedded copper planes and then combine it with the outer copper plane.

**Procedure**

Choose one of the following:

- Select the embedded copper plane, right-click and click the **Bring to front** popup menu item. This sets the embedded copper plane to a lower "Flood priority", ensuring it floods before the outer copper plane.
- Alternatively, perform the following steps:
- i. Create a copper plane cut out on the outside perimeter of all embedded copper planes. (For more information, see [Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out.](#page-19-0))
- ii. Select the copper plane cut out polygon shape.
- iii. Press the Ctrl key and select the next outer copper plane.
- iv. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item.

## Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out
A copper plane cut out is a closed, non-self-intersecting polygon that defines a void within a copper plane. Creating a cut out involves combining the copper plane shape with the copper plane cut out shape.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You can create the cut out before the copper plane or the copper plane before the cut out.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Although it appears to create a void in the edge or outline of a copper plane when in hatch outline mode, a copper plane cut out does not actually alter the copper plane outline. Create the copper plane outline as a polygon shape to create features in the outline.
- You must put the copper plane cut out on the same layer as the copper plane.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper Plane Cut Out** button.
- 2. Create one or more cut out areas for the copper plane.

See "Creating a Drafting Object" for more information.

3. Right-click and click **Select Shapes**.

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** If you cannot see a cut out within the copper plane shape because the shape is flooded, type the modeless command **PO** to return the copper plane to pour outline display mode. You will need to re-flood the copper plane once you have combined the cut out with the copper plane.

4. Drag a box to group-select the copper plane and cut out(s).

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_19_Picture_20.jpeg)

**Note:** Some circumstances do not allow for dragging a group selection box. Instead, use Ctrl +click to select the copper plane and the cut out.

- 5. Right-click and click the **Combine** popup menu item.
- 6. "Flood the copper plane"on page 780.

The copper plane area inside the cut out area is automatically removed. If you need to move or edit the copper plane or the cut out, be aware that any modifications you make to the copper plane shape (move, rotate, miter, and so on,) also affect the combined cut out(s). You may need to uncombine it first. For instructions, see "Uncombining Drafting Objects"on page 643.

**Results**

![](/layout/guide/31/_page_20_Picture_5.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Starting with VX.2.3, copper floods to the inner edge of completed cut out outlines instead of the centerline. Prior to VX.2.3, the cut out would grow by half the line width since copper would flood to its centerline rather than the inner edge which was the intended boundary.

As you draw the cut out shape, the drawn geometry appears in a single screen pixel line.

**Figure 88. Cut Out Outline While Drawing the Shape**

Once completed, the outline uses a real line width but is positioned completely outside the perimeter of the drawn geometry to help visualize the cut out prior to flooding.

**Figure 89. Composite of Drawn and Display Outlines**

Once the copper is poured, it pours to the perimeter of the drawn geometry - the inside edge of the cut out display outline.

## Assigning Copper Plane Thermal Attributes
A thermal setting is assigned to all pad stacks in the design automatically.

Use the Plane Thermal check box in the Pin Propertieson page 1632, Via Properties on page 1779, and Jumper Pin Propertieson page 1422 dialog boxes to determine whether the pad stack is an eligible thermal candidate. Turn the Plane Thermal check box off if you do not want any type of thermal relief on any layer of the pad stack.

For more information, see "Generating Thermals".

## Discarding Copper Plane Data on Save
If desired, you can discard copper plane data and save only the plane polygons when you save the design file.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Copper Planes** (category), **Hatch and Flood**  (subcategory).
- 2. In the Save to PCB File area, select the "Copper Plane polygon outlines" option and click **OK**.
- 3. Click the **Tools > Copper Plane Manager** menu item to flood the copper planeon page 780.
- 4. Save the design.

The "Discarding Copper Plane Data Dialog Box"on page 1314 appears.

5. Click **Proceed** to save only the copper plane polygons. Click **Save All** to save all copper plane data and change the option for future saves.

## Display of Connections for Pads Connected to a Copper Plane
You can hide the connection lines (ratsnest or unroute connections) of nets assigned to a copper plane. Plane nets are typically power or ground nets; hiding them can help to clear the design space and reduce the connections to those that require more difficult routing.

Plane net connections can be made by through-hole pins connecting directly to the copper plane, or through fanout (short trace ending with a via) connections. These nets do not usually require long traces and are often not important in the strategic placement of the part - unless the copper plane to which they are attached is only in a certain area of the board. You can use the View Nets dialog box to hide the unroute connections of any or all nets in the design.

For more information, see "View Nets Dialog Box".
