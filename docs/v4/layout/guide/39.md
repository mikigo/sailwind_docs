## Design for Test
To support In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures, SailWind Layout's DFT Audit can help you manage in-circuit test points. Using parameters that you set, DFT Audit can analyze all nets in the design, automatically assign test point attributes to the appropriate vias and component pins on accessible (adaptable) nets, add test points to adaptable nets that are already routed, and report inaccessible (nonadaptable) nets.

For non-adaptable nets, DFT Audit can add test point vias and place them outside the board outline. These capabilities help you consider ICT early in the design process, improving your productivity by reducing potential iterations of a manual DFT Audit.

To manually assign a component pin or via as a test point, you add a test point setting to the object. A test point can be one pin of a multiple pin component, the only pin of a single test point component, or a via.

DFT Audit assigns vias and component pins as test points rather than adding several single pin components. Therefore, you avoid backward annotation of test point information to the schematic. For more information, see "Test Point [Definition](#page-2-0)".

When you run DFT Audit, SailWind Layout automatically transfers the design to SailWind Router. Using parameters that you set in SailWind Layout, SailWind Router analyzes all nets for adaptability and adds test points to routed adaptable nets. Note that SailWind Router may reroute nets during DFT Audit. When SailWind Router is done, it transfers the design back to SailWind Layout. For nets that SailWind Router determines to be non-adaptable, SailWind Layout can optionally add test points, which are placed outside the board edge. When DFT Audit finishes, the DFT Audit Board Report appears.

To access the DFT Audit, click DFT Audit on the Tools menu. For information about running DFT Audit, see the [Performing](#page-4-0) a Test Point Audit topic.

**Restriction:**

DFT Audit tolerates slotted holes, but does not test them for adaptability.

While you can run DFT Audit in either SailWind Layout or SailWind Router, the dialog box used to set a DFT Audit option depends on the program you are running. For more information, see "Mapping SailWind Layout DFT Audit Settings to SailWind Router".

### Test Point Definition
Specific test point terminology is used to describe the various parameters used in setting up your test points in the design.

<span id="page-2-2"></span>[Figure](#page-2-2) 117 show the different parts of a test point, while [Table](#page-2-3) [126](#page-2-3)describes the parts.

### Compare Test Points
Use Compare Test Points to compare test point settings in ASCII format, between the current file and another file.

1. You need an ASCII file of test points from an older version of the design file.

For more information, see "[Creating](#page-4-1) a Test Point ASCII File".

- 2. Click the **Tools > Compare Test Points** menu item to open the Compare Test Points dialog box.
- 3. Locate or type the name of the ASCII test point file to compare against.

You do not need to type the *.asc* extension.

4. Click **OK**. SailWind Layout creates an internal ASCII test point list of the open file and compares it to the one you specified.

If the ASCII file you compare against is a version earlier than PowerPCB 2.x, or if a test point section is not present in the ASCII file, an error message appears. Create another file to compare against.

When differences exist, the output error file *tpasc.lst* opens listing the differences.

### Performing a Test Point Audit
Use DFT (Design For Test) Audit to manage test points used to support In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures. Test points help you meet your ICT requirements early in the design process and can improve your productivity by reducing design iterations.

When you run DFT Audit, SailWind Layout automatically transfers the design to SailWind Router. Using options you set in SailWind Layout, SailWind Router analyzes all nets for accessibility and adds test points to routed accessible nets. Note that SailWind Router may reroute nets during DFT Audit. When SailWind Router is done, it transfers the design back to SailWind Layout. For nets that SailWind Router determines to be inaccessible, SailWind Layout can optionally add test points, which are placed outside the board edge. When DFT Audit finishes, the DFT Audit Board Report appears.

**Prerequisites**

- SailWind Router must be installed and licensed for you to run DFT Audit in SailWind Layout. You can run DFT Audit regardless of the layer limits in the SailWind Router license.
- If you are using BGAs, fan out the BGAs before running DFT Audit.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item.
- 2. On the DFT Audit dialog box, click the tab for which you want to modify the test point placement options and properties:
	- [Optionson page 866](#page-5-0)
	- [Propertieson page 867](#page-6-0)
	- [Assignmenton page 868](#page-7-0)
- 3. Modify the properties on the tab as required.
- 4. Click **Run**. The automatic audit process starts.

### Placing Test Points
Several options for placing test points are available to you on the **Options** tab of the DFT Audit dialog box. Choose the options that best fit the requirements of your current design.

**Tip** To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Options** tab.
- 2. Define how test points are created using options in the Create test points area.

You can preserve existing via properties and add test point vias to routed, accessible nets.

- 3. Set probe via test point properties using options in the Probe through area.
- 4. Place via test points on a grid using options in the Place via points using area.
- 5. Specify test point nail diameters using options in the Available Nail Diameters area.
- 6. Set minimum pad areas using options in the Minimum Pad Probing Sizes area.

Set minimum pad probing sizes for both vias and component pins to ensure that there is sufficient pad area for probe contact.

### Setting Test Point Properties
Several test point properties are available to you on the **Properties** tab of the DFT Audit dialog box that allow you to specify many of the physical characteristics of test points.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_6_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip**

To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Properties** tab.
- 2. Specify the minimum distances between the probe and other design objects using options in the Probe Minimum Distances area.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_6_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Tip** The clearances needed between a probe and another design object are mostly based on the physical constraints of the Automated Test Equipment (ATE) used by In Circuit Testing (ICT) procedures. The probes extending out of the ATE fixture must make contact with the PCB without interference from any obstacles. This means that test points must keep a fixed distance from component bodies, pads, mounting holes, and the board edge, and must also have the minimum spacing between them.

- 3. Specify the maximum length of trace stubs required to make a net accessible to a test probe by typing the length into the Stub Length box.
- 4. Specify zero or more than one nail pins on a net using options in the Multiple Test Point Nets area.

By default, all nets are set to receive one probe, or nail pin. If you do not want any nail pins on a net, double-click the Nail Pins cell for the net and type zero (0). If you want to change the number of nail pins for a net to receive, in the Multiple Test Point Nets area, type the new value in the Nail Pins cell for the net.

To display only nets with no nail pin or with more than one nail pin, select the Show Only Nets with Nail Pins Not Equal to One check box.

To sort the list by a different column, click the column header at the top of the list.

### Setting Test Point Assignment Eligibility
Use the **Assignment** tab to prevent or favor assigning test points to components or to via types. By default, all pins on a net are available for test pin assignment and are evenly weighted as test point candidates.

**Tip** To reduce design iterations, consult with your automated test engineers when setting DFT Audit options.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DFT Audit** menu item, then select the **Assignment** tab.
- 2. To prevent use as a test point, select the Exclude check box.
- 3. To favor use as a test point, select the Prefer check box.
- 4. To apply even weighting, clear the Exclude and Prefer check boxes.

To change the check box value for multiple rows, select the rows and then click a check box.

To sort the spreadsheet by a specific column, click that column's header.

## DFF, Design For Fabrication
To support fabrication design rules, SailWind Layout provides fabrication checks with Verify Design. This functionality, called DFF Audit (Design For Fabrication) , lets you either check for fabrication errors within SailWind Layout or backward annotate errors from the CAM product, CAM350. DFF Audit detects potential errors in a design, so that you can identify these problems prior to board fabrication.

The checking within SailWind Layout uses the CAM document definitions to determine if fabrication errors exist. The CAM documents determine the photoplotter output and include layer composites, oversize, suppression, and other masking preferences. All electrical layers are analyzed to check acid traps and copper sliver fabrication. To check mask sliver and solder mask bridge fabrication, the solder mask layers are analyzed. To check silkscreen over pads, silkscreen layers are compared to solder mask layers.

Design for [Fabrication](#page-14-1) Workflow [Process Flow for Using DFF Audit](#page-14-2) [DFF Audit Process Flow using CAM350 Link](#page-15-1)

### Design for Fabrication Workflow
Design For Fabrication is best accomplished using a structured workflow to define the various steps of the process.

The table below shows the basic workflow for auditing your design for fabrication.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_14_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 118. Design for Fabrication Workflow**

## Exporting to CAM350
You can translate a SailWind Layout design using CAM350 Link. This allows you to perform additional design analysis on your design in the CAM350 environment.

**Prerequisites**

You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.

- 1. Create a SailWind Layout design.
- 2. Click the **File> Export** menu item, and in the Save as type list, click CAM350 and then click **Save**. The CAM350 dialog box appears.
- 3. Choose a mode to either create the CAM350 *.cam* file only, or create the file and automatically launch CAM350.
- 4. In the Layer Options area, select an option for the amount of PADS design detail to translate to the CAM350 database.
- 5. Arcs in polygon shapes, such as copper planes, are approximated using straight edges. In the Arc Approximation Tolerance box, type the minimum allowable distance between the actual arc path and the approximated straight-line segments. This appears in the appropriate design units, which you set on the Options dialog box > **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 6. In the CAM350 File Name box, type a *.cam* path and file name or click Browse to navigate to a location.

The default file name and path are the same name as the current design file name and path.

- 7. Click **OK**.

Colors must be assigned properly in the Display Colors dialog box in order to see error markers. Errors in the design area appear in the color of the Errors check boxes per layer of the Display Colors dialog box. When an error is selected in the Location box, the error in the design area appears in the Highlight color.

**Procedure**

1. You open the Verify Design database to perform a design check and generate a list of any errors occurring in your design.

See ["Running a Design Check"on page 883](#page-22-1) for instructions.

- 2. With the "Verify Design dialog box" on page 1775 still open, select an error from the Location list.
- 3. The design window pans to the area of the error (unless you select Disable Panning first).

The pan to the area of the area is more obvious if you are zoomed into your design.

**Tip** You can prevent the design area from panning to errors when you select them if you select the Disable Panning check box in the Verify Design dialog box.

The generated error list remains whether the dialog box is open or closed. If you close the dialog box, you can view the list in the error report file. You can access the report file by clicking the link that appears in the Output window.

**Note:** Error markers are not erased from the design until you click **Clear Errors** which clears the error markers, not the actual errors. You must correct the error in the design.

#### Interpreting Error Markers
After verifying the design, error markers are inserted in a SailWind Layout database as database objects. Error objects present in a SailWind Layout database transfer into SailWind Router and are converted into SailWind Router error objects during file load.

**Tip** Within SailWind Router you can assign an error as ignored. An ignored error status makes the error marker invisible but leaves the error in the database. SailWind Layout supports storage of the ignored status on errors; however, ignored status can only be assigned or unassigned within SailWind Router. In SailWind Layout, ignored errors are not invisible. Ignored errors invisible in SailWind Router saved to a SailWind Layout file will be visible when the file is loaded into SailWind Layout. But ignored errors remain as ignored after a file is saved in SailWind Layout and loaded SailWind Router.

Most error objects in SailWind Layout are converted to an identical SailWind Router error object. The exceptions to these conversions are listed in the Notes column of the table below.

### Troubleshoot Design Verify Errors
There are different types of errors such as clearance errors, subnet errors and untied plane pin errors. Interpreting them correctly will help you clear them from the design quickly.

**Clearance Errors**

Clearance errors can report a Same net clearance error with an error explanation of Distance between pads too small.

Although there is no specific SMD-to-SMD and SMD-to-Pad clearances, the SMD-to-Via clearance rule is used.

**Subnet Errors**

Connectivity checks often report a subnet error.

There are several causes of subnet errors:

- **An unassigned net**  the net is not assigned to the plane area. Open the properties of the plane area shapeon page 1328 and ensure that a net is assigned to the shape. You can only assign a net while the shape is in outline mode.
- **A small unroute**  turn off all layers in the Display Colors Setup Dialog Box. Assign a bright color to Connections and search the design for unroutes.

**Tip**

You might find a connection to a pin that is not fully routed to the center of the pad. It's also easier to spot these if you assign a different color between pads and traces and enable the transparent mode to see the trace "underneath" the pad.

- **An unplated component pin**  check the pad stacks propertieson page 1566 of the component pin and ensure the Plated check box is selected.
- **A via or pad without a plane thermal**  open the Via Properties on page 1779 or Pin Propertieson page 1632 dialog box and ensure the Plane Thermal check box is selected.

A Full Plane Check with Same Layer Connectivity Check will also display a subnet error which is caused only by isolated planes. For more information, see ["Plane Checking Setup](#page-51-0)".

**Untied Plane Pin Errors**

Plane checks sometimes report untied plane pin errors.

There are a few causes of untied plane pin errors:

- An unplated pin or via
- A pin with a pad size on a plane layer that is greater than the drill size plus the drill oversize
- A pin without the thermal attribute set

### Saving and Printing Error Results
You can print error results, or alternatively, view the current error results in your default text editor.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. To view the most recently run report results in the default text editor, click **View Report**. You can print or save the results from your default text editor.

**Related Topics**

[Setting Default Report File Names](#page-27-1)

### Setting Default Report File Names
When you run a Verify Design check, a report file is created with a unique name for each check type.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. To specify the default file name of each report type click **Report File**.

This opens the Save As dialog box where you can name the report that you will run, if you do not want to use the default reference name for the report type.

If you do not give the report a unique name, it is always saved to the default file name.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_28_Picture_3.jpeg)

### Previewing Fabrication Errors in CAM files
After you run a Fabrication check that reports errors, you can preview the CAM layer document associated with the error. The Preview button is available only when fabrication checking is enabled and lists errors.

**Prerequisites**

You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. Select an error in the Location box.
- 3. Click **Preview**.

**Results**

The CAM Preview Dialog Boxopens.

**Tip** Since error markers are not added to the CAM document, it helps to zoom into the design area before you click Preview. If the CAM Preview does not open zoomed into the same area, you can click the Workspace button in the Cam Preview window to match the workspace view.

**Note:**

In the CAM Preview window, click **Setup** to change the preview settings of the specified document in the preview area.

### Back-annotating CAM350 Files
Backward annotation begins by parsing the specified CAM350 file for DFM errors. For each error listed in the file an error marker is added to the SailWind Layout database, at the error location.

**Prerequisites**

- You need the CAM350 Link license option to use this.
- Existing DFM error markers in the SailWind Layout database are cleared before the CAM350 file is parsed.

**Procedure**

- 1. Perform DFM error analysis in CAM350 and save the file.
- 2. Open the design file in SailWind Layout.
- 3. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 4. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, choose the Fabrication option.
- 5. Click **Setup**.
- 6. In the Fabrication Checking Setup Dialog Boxchoose the Annotate DFF Errors option.
- 7. Type the name or browse for the CAM350 file in which DFM errors were saved.
- 8. Click **Start** in the Verify Design dialog box. [DFM error markerson page 885](#page-24-0) appear wherever errors exist in the design. They also appear in the Location list with their location.
- 9. Correct existing errors and regenerate the CAM350 database.

### Adding Nets or Classes for Specific High-Speed Checks
You can run specific electrodynamic checks on nets or classes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the High Speed option.
- 3. Click **Setup**, then click **Add Nets** or **Add Classes**.
- 4. Select a net or class and then click **OK**.

**Tip**

You can select more than one item using Ctrl+click. You can select a range using Shift +click or by dragging the cursor.

### Setting Up Clearance Checking
Use the Clearance Checking Setup dialog box to specify which clearances to check during a Clearance verification.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

**CAUTION:**

Clearance checks are only applied to design objects that are visible in the workspace view at your current zoom level and only those design objects with their colors are turned on. If you are zoomed in or have objects turned off, they are ignored by the clearance check.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Clearance checking only checks the visible area of the design.
- Reference designator, part type, and attribute labels are not checked for clearance violations.
- Clearance checking does not check against 2D lines.
- Clearance checking is not performed on CAM Planes.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Clearance option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the check box beside any types of clearance checks you want to enable and then click **OK**.

Design Rule Hierarchy

### Setting Up Checking for Isolated Stitching Vias
During design verification, you can use the Connectivity Check to report isolated routing vias and isolated stitching vias.

(An isolated stitching via is a stitching via that is not connected to any hatch outline or copper area.) However, to have the check report isolated stitching vias, you must first set it up to ignore connections to CAM planes.

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Connectivity option and then click **Setup**.
- 3. In the Connectivity Checking Setup dialog box, select the Ignore CAM plane connection for isolated stitching vias check box and click **OK**.

**Results**

When you verify the design, the checking operation reports isolated stitching vias as errors and marks them in the design, along with the other errors found during checking.

### Setting Up Latium Checking
Latium checking performs advanced design checking using the Latium technology contained with SailWind Router.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Latium Design Verification option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the "Net to All" check box to check clearance rules on each net or hierarchical level against any other obstacle type.
- 4. Select the Board Outline check box to check clearance rules for the board outline and board cut outs.
- 5. Select the Off Board Text check box to check for off-board text and to flag all instances of off-board text as clearance errors.
- 6. Select the Keepout check box to check for keepout restriction violations.
- 7. Select the Same Net check box to check clearances between objects along the same net, as specified in the Clearance Rules dialog box.

For more information, see "Design Rule Hierarchy".

8. Select the Drill to Drill check box to check clearances between all drill holes. Pad stack drill size plus the drill oversize value calculate the diameter for plated holes.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_31_Picture_19.jpeg)

**Tip** Drill to drill errors are reported for only one layer in a drill pair.

9. Select the Trace Width check box to check traces in excess of minimum and maximum widths, specified in the Clearance Rules dialog box.

For more information, see "Design Rule Hierarchy".

10. Select the Placement Outline check box to check outline against outline with the following considerations:

- In default layer mode, check outline against outline on layer 20, not on electrical layers.
- In increased layer mode, check outline against outline on layer 120.

**Tip**

You can create outlines on layer 20 (or 120) that do not exactly match the actual component outline. By setting a larger outline on this layer, you can leave an area near a component open for other purposes. This check ensures this area is left open.

11. Select the Via at SMD check box to check for via at SMD restriction violations.

For more information, see "Pad Entry Rules Dialog Box".

12. Select the Differential Pairs check box to check for differential pair restriction violations.

For more information, see "Creating Differential Pair Design Rules".

13. Select the Trace Length check box to check for length restriction violations.

For more information, see "HiSpeed Rules Dialog Box".

14. Select the Test Point check box to check test points on the design.

Test Points checks for probe clearances, minimum via/pad sizes for probing, SMD pin probing, test points on component pin on the component side, test point count per net settings and nail diameter settings, and compares the settings against the setting in the DFT Audit program. For more information, see "[Performing](#page-4-0) a Test Point Audit".

**Results**

Latium design checks are performed with the following restrictions:

- Reference designator, part type, and attribute labels are not checked for clearance violations.
- Latium design verification performs clearance checking on only the visible area of the design. When clearance checking against the board outline, the edge of the object is checked against the centerline of the board outline.
- Drill to Drill errors are reported for only one layer in a drill pair.
- Test point checking is the same whether you enable the checking on the Latium Checking Setup dialog box or on the Verify Design dialog box. If you plan to perform Latium design verification, you can eliminate an extra design transfer between SailWind Layout and SailWind Router by running test point checking with the other Latium checks.

#### Acid Traps
An acid trap is a location where, due to the surface tension of the etching, acid gets trapped in an area. This acid causes over-etching, which hurts yield. The acid trap runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

<span id="page-34-3"></span>Acid Trap Maximum Size indicates the maximum size of the acid traps to flag. The area of pools that are flagged will be less than this value [\(Figure](#page-34-3) 119).

**Figure 119. Acid Trap Maximum Size**

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_34_Picture_8.jpeg)

<span id="page-34-4"></span>Acid Trap Maximum Angle is an angle from 1 to 89 degrees. Any copper items (traces, pads, or any other objects that exist on the layer) that form an angle smaller than this are flagged as an acid trap ([Figure](#page-34-4) [120\)](#page-34-4).

**Figure 120. Acid Trap Maximum Angle**

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_34_Picture_11.jpeg)

#### Slivers
Copper slivers are areas in the copper that are so narrow they may flake off. This check detects potential slivers on the electrical and composite layers in the design.

Copper slivers ([Figure 121\)](#page-35-1) should be eliminated whenever possible to prevent defect from occurring during the etching process.

<span id="page-35-1"></span>Minimum Copper indicates the maximum size of the copper slivers to flag. This flags slivers of a width less than this value. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

**Figure 121. Sliver**

Mask slivers in the solder mask layer are areas where the solder mask is so narrow they may flake off. These flakes float around and may drop into an area that needs to be soldered later, resulting in a bad board.

<span id="page-35-2"></span>Minimum Mask [\(Figure 122](#page-35-2)) indicates the maximum size of the slivers to flag. This flags slivers of a width less than this value. This check runs top and bottom solder mask layers, if visible as defined by CAM documents.

**Figure 122. Minimum Mask Size**

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_35_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### Solder Bridges
When a mask layer is created, openings for pads may be oversized too much and expose an adjacent trace or other conductive object. Therefore, during fabrication, the copper for that pad may become too close and create a bridge to the adjacent object. Solder bridges are usually caused by problems during mask data creation.

The CAD system used may be unable to validate that what was created is going to work.

<span id="page-35-3"></span>The Minimum Gap [\(Figure 123](#page-35-3)) is the maximum distance the solder can bridge and cause a connection to an adjacent object within the same mask opening. If the adjacent object is farther from the pad than this distance, even if the mask layer exposes it, it will not be identified as a bridge.

**896 SailWind Layout Guide and Reference**

#### Starved Thermals
Many designs are plagued by thermal pad problems for negative CAM planes because the CAD system did not verify whether the thermals were going to make good connections to the copper plane.

The Starved Thermals fabrication check verifies whether each thermal connection to the negative CAM plane is valid, or if it has been constricted by adjacent data that is too close or overlapping – effectively starving out the ties. This check runs on all visible CAM negative plane layers as defined by CAM documents.

Starved Thermal Minimum Clearance is the percentage of the area next to the spoke of the thermal that must not be blocked by another object. Any smaller opening is considered starved.

![](/layout/guide/39/_page_36_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 124. Starved Thermals**

Starved Thermal Minimum Spokes is the number of thermal spokes that cannot be blocked by another object. Any less will be considered starved. The number of spokes is specified as EVERY, meaning all spokes must not be blocked, or as an integer from 1 to 4.

#### Annular Ring
The Annular Ring area lets you set up annular ring checks by comparing data on different layers. This test checks both the size and the offset between the two layers.

The checks (described in the table below) assure that proper clearances are observed to alleviate manufacturing problems in the board fabrication processes. Layers to be tested are derived from CAM documents and pad stack data. This area provides selections for pad, mask, and drill checks. When drill sizes are analyzed for annular rings, the drill oversize setting on the Tools > Options > Design tab is not considered.

**Table 129. Annular Ring Checks(continued)**

#### Silkscreen Over Pads
The Silkscreen Over Pads check lets you set up the clearance for comparing data on silkscreen layers against top and bottom electrical layers. This check analyzes both the size and the offset between the two layers.

Layers to be tested are derived from CAM documents and pad stack data. This check is run for top and bottom electrical layers against their associated silkscreen layers.

**Figure 125. Comparing Data on Silkscreen Layers**

#### Trace Width/Pad Size
The Trace Width/Pad Size check runs minimum trace width and minimum pad size checks for electrical layers.

The Trace Width check detects small electrical traces on the electrical layers in the design. Minimum Trace indicates the maximum size of the traces to flag. Traces with a width less than this value will be flagged. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

The Pad Size check detects small pads on the electrical layers in the design before the board is manufactured. Minimum Pad indicates the maximum size of the pads to flag. Pads with a diameter less than this value will be flagged. This check runs on all visible electrical layers as defined by CAM documents.

### Fabrication Check Types
Fabrication checks are used to verify that a design is manufacturable and that typical fabrication issues have been eliminated from the design.

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Fabrication option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the Annular Ring check box to enable the Pad to Mask, Drill to Mask and Drill to Pad checks.
- 4. The series of pad checking options are enabled for further definition.

#### Pad to Mask
Use the Pad to Mask check to flag minimum clearance distances between a pad and its solder mask opening. The offset and annular ring is checked against the specified clearance value. This compares the top electrical layer against the top solder mask layer or the bottom electrical layer against the bottom solder mask layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Fabrication option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the Pad to Mask check box.
- 4. In the box, type the minimum clearance value.
- 5. In the Layers list, select the layer to use for checking.

#### Drill to Mask
Use the Drill to Mask check to flag minimum clearance distances between a drill and its solder mask opening. The offset and annular ring is checked against the specified clearance value. This compares the top drill layer against the top solder mask layer or the bottom drill layer against the bottom solder mask layer.

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the **Fabrication** option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the Drill to Mask check box.
- 4. In the box, type the minimum clearance value.
- 5. In the **Layers** list, select the layer to use for checking.

#### Drill to Pad
Use the Drill to Pad check to flag minimum clearance distances between a drill and its associated pad. The offset and annular ring is checked against the specified clearance value. This check is run on each specified layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Fabrication option, and then click **Setup**.
- 3. Select the Drill to Pad check box.
- 4. In the box, type the minimum clearance value.
- 5. In the Layers list, select the layer to use for checking.

#### Checking Solder Bridges
Use this check to flag solder mask bridging. Solder can bridge and cause a connection to an adjacent object within the same mask opening. If the adjacent object is farther from the pad than this distance, even if it is exposed by the mask layer, it will not be identified as a bridge.

This compares the top solder mask layer against the top electrical layer or the bottom solder mask layer against the bottom electrical layer as defined in the CAM documents.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Verify Design** menu item.
- 2. In the Verify Design Dialog Box, in the Check area, select the Fabrication option, and then click **Setup**.

### Check the Plane Connection for Continuity
When you run a continuity check in Verify Design, the net checks are connected if no errors are found.

Run the Plane check to see whether a pad exists in the connecting pad stack for the plane level, for example; is the pad size more than 0 or does the drill size exceed pad size? For links to SMD pads, it checks whether the pad-to-via connection connects to the plane.
