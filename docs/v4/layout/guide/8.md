## Part Types
You cannot add a part to a SailWind Layout design, or import the part as a component of a netlist, unless the library has an available part type and a PCB decal for the part.

- The PCB decal represents the "footprint" of the part (including pad and drill sizes) on the board, and is required both to place the part on the board and to route the nets connecting to the part's pins.
- The part type represents the electrical configuration of the part, including its logic family, pins, gates and gate pins, and mapping of gate pins to the part's pins. It also includes other information, such as part attributes and the list of PCB decals assigned to the part. When you add a part to a design, it is added as an instance of the part type.

You [create a new SailWind part typeon page 230](#page-1-0), or [modify an existing part typeon page 235](#page-6-0), by specifying the properties of the part in the tabs of the Part Information dialog box, as follows:

- General on page 1590Part statistics, logic family, pin number mapping status, connector status, ECO-registered status, list of reference designator prefixes to define the set of parts to which these properties apply, define part as special purpose (connector, die part, or flip chip).
- PCB Decals on page 1593List of assigned PCB Decals. You must assign a decal to the part before specifying gate information, signal pin names, and alphanumeric pin names.
- Gates on page 1588Default and alternative gates, gate swapping eligibility, gate properties, gate pin-swapping eligibility.
- Pins on page 1596Signal names for pins, such as power and ground pins.
- Attributes on page 1584Attributes of the part.
- Connectors on page 1586Default and alternative CAE decals used as connectors in SailWind Logic. This tab is unavailable when the Connector check box on the General tab is cleared, or when a gate has been assigned to the part on the Gates tab.
- Pin Mapping on page 1600Optional pin mapping of logical to physical pin numbers This tab is unavailable when you select the Define Mapping Of Part Type Pin Numbers To PCB Decal check box on the General tab, and assign one or more decals containing alphanumeric pin numbers. The decal determines the number of pins in the part.

## Creation of a New Part Type
You can create new part types for a large selection of component types.

There are five different component types that require specific instructions to create the part type:

- The component is an electrical part, and the logical and physical pin numbering is the same--both numeric, or both alphanumeric. For detailed instructions, see "[Creating](#page-1-1) a Part Type with Identical [Schematic and Layout Pin Numbering](#page-1-1)".
- The component is an electrical part, and the logical and physical pin numbering is different--the logical is alphanumeric and the physical is numeric. For detailed instructions, see ["Creating a Part](#page-2-0) Type with Different Schematic and Layout Pin [Numbering](#page-2-0)".
- The component is a connector. For detailed instructions, see "Creating a [Connector](#page-5-0) Part Type".
- The component will not be ECO registered. For detailed instructions, see "[Creating a Non-ECO-](#page-3-0)[Registered](#page-3-0) Part Type".
- The component is a non-electrical part, such as a mounting screw or locating post, that is not connected to any net. For detailed instructions, see "Creating a [Non-Electrical](#page-4-0) Part Type".

## Creating a Part Type with Identical Schematic and Layout Pin Numbering
You can create a part type that uses the same logical and physical pin numbering. You can choose either alphanumeric-to-alphanumeric or numeric-to-numeric for the schematic-to-layout pin numbering.

[Modification of Gates in Parts in the Library](#page-8-0)

### Modification of Gates in Parts in the Library
You can modify parts in the library using the Library Manager. Information you can modify includes location, decal, connector, gates, alphanumerics, signal pins, and attributes.

For each gate, you can type the CAE Decal name; the name of the logic symbol that is used to display the part in the schematic. Alternate decal assignments must have the same number of pins. You can define one primary and three alternate decals for each gate.

When at least one decal is assigned to a part, you can type or modify its gate information. This includes swap enabling or disabling for gates within a part or between similar parts. This information lets SailWind Layout know which gates it can substitute for connection length minimization after placement.

You can also swap pins within gates to uncross connections and facilitate routing. In both gate and pin swapping, you assign a number to the gate or pin in the Gates tab. Pins with like numbers can swap within a gate. Gates with like numbers can swap within the part, or to other similar parts. A one (1) indicates the gate is swappable with gates of the same part type in the PCB design database. If a part contains more than one type of swappable gate, then identify the second type with the number 2, the third type with 3, and so on. Zero (0) indicates that no swapping can occur.

For more information, see the Creating and [Modifying](#page-0-1) Part Types [on page 229](#page-0-1)topic.

### Modifying the Pins Table Information
The Pins table contains the mapping of the pins data and allows you to add, edit, and renumber the pins.

[Adding](#page-10-1) a Series of Pins to the Pins Table [Editing](#page-11-0) Pins Table Data [Renumbering](#page-12-1) Pins in the Pins Table

#### Adding a Series of Pins to the Pins Table
You can use the Add Pins dialog box to add a series of pins to the Pins table instead of adding one pin at a time.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager dialog boxon page 1449, select a Library, and then click the **Parts** button.
- 3. Select a part, and then click the **Edit** button.
- 4. In the Part Information for Part dialog box, select the Pins tabon page 1596.
- 5. Click the **Add Pins** button.
- 6. In the Add Pins Dialog Box, type the number of pins to add in the Number of pins box. Total pins for the part can not exceed 32,767 pins.
- 7. In the Start pin number area, type values in the Prefix and/or Suffix boxes. A preview of pin numbers based on your input is displayed below the boxes. Alphabetic and numeric values can be used in either box. For example, A1 or 1A. For a single numeric, use either Prefix or Suffix box, and void the other box.

![](/layout/guide/8/_page_10_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Note:**

If you type alphanumerics and the decal uses numerics, you must use the **Pin Mapping**  tab to map the alphanumerics onto the decal.

- 8. In the Increment options area, choose what to increment by clicking either the Increment prefix or Increment suffix option.
- 9. In the Step value box, type a positive or negative number by which to increase or decrease the pin numbers with consecutive or stepped values.
- 10. If using alphanumerics, you can select the Use JEDEC pin numbering check box to ensure that legal alphanumeric values are used.
- 11. When you have finished modifying the properties, click **OK** to save the changes.
- 12. Click **OK** to close the Part Information for Part dialog box.

[Creation](#page-1-0) of a New Part Type

#### Editing Pins Table Data
You can click a cell in the row of the pin you are editing to edit the cell contents, or select one or more cells of the same column and click the **Edit** button.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager dialog boxon page 1449, select a Library, and then click the **Parts** button.
- 3. Select a part, and then click the **Edit** button.
- 4. In the Part Information for Part dialog box, select the Pins tabon page 1596.
- 5. Click the Pin Group cell and in the list, choose from gate, signal pin, or unused pin. Gates listed in the Pin Group cell list are added using the **Gates** tab. Signal pins require a signal name in the Name cell.
- 6. Click the Number cell and type a pin number for the pin. Typically, the pin number should match those used in the PCB decal. For example, alphanumeric to alphanumeric. Pin numbers can be either numeric or alphanumeric.

**Note:**

Prior to PADS2007, alphanumeric pin numbers were not legal on the PCB decal but overlaid the numeric decal numbers, and were stored within the Part Type. If your logical schematic symbol uses alphanumeric pin numbering, you can continue to keep numeric PCB decals and use the **Pin Mapping** tab to overlay different alphanumeric pin numbers onto the numeric PCB decal pin numbers.

7. Click the Name cell and type a pin signal or function name. For example, "Clock" or "CLK." A pin name is not required. The Name column is not used for unused pins.

![](/layout/guide/8/_page_11_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:**

Gate pin names can contain up to 40 characters, while signal pin names can contain up to 47. All alphanumeric characters are accepted. You cannot use special characters such as question marks ?, curly braces { }, asterisks \*, periods ., commas , , or spaces.

- 8. Click the Type cell and in the list, choose a pin type. The type column is only used with gate pins.
- 9. Click the Swap cell and type a swap number, or use the up/down arrows. You swap pins within gates to uncross connections and facilitate routing. Pins with like numbers can swap within a gate. Type 0 to disable swapping.
- 10. Click the Sequence (Seq.) cell and type the gate sequence number. The sequence number determines the mapping of CAE gate pins to PCB decal pins. The sequence is automatically shared with alternate CAE decals. For example, it shows how pin numbers appear on the CAE gate decal; therefore, in Gate A, sequence number 1 could be pin 1, but in Gate B, sequence number 1 would be pin 4.

![](/layout/guide/8/_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Note:** When editing pin data for connectors, only the Pin Group and Number columns are relevant. Data entered in other columns is rejected. Connectors do not have gates, so the Pin Group column just indicates whether a pin is a connector pin or an unused pin.

11. When you have finished modifying the properties, click **OK** to save the changes.

### Assigning Special Symbols to a Connector
Use the Browse for Special Symbols dialog box to assign one or more pin decals, or Special Symbols, to a connector. Doing so allows you to use any of the special symbols as alternate pins of the connector.

Instead of displaying it as a single symbol, SailWind Layout breaks up the connector into individual pin symbols in the schematic. You can place the pins all together, or wherever you like, on a single page or even across multiple pages.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager dialog boxon page 1449, select a Library, and then click the **Parts** button.
- 3. Select a part, and then click the **Edit** button.

### Mapping Alphanumeric Pin Numbers to Numeric Decals
You can complete the pin mapping in one of several ways.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **File> Library** menu item.
- 2. In the Library Manager dialog boxon page 1449, select a Library, and then click the **Parts** button.
- 3. Select a part, and then click the **Edit** button.
- 4. In the Part Information for Part dialog box, select the Pin Mapping tabon page 1600.
- 5. In the decal list above the preview window, select the assigned decal to which you want to map alphanumeric pins.
- 6. Map the pins using one of the following methods

**CAUTION:**

If there are any errors in the pin numbering, correct them by editing the table on the **Pins**  tab. Do not attempt to renumber pins in the table on the **Pin Mapping** tab.

- **Using the Part Type column** Select a cell in the Part Type column and click the **Edit** button, or simply double-click the cell. Then type a pin number. The pin number is removed from the Unmapped pins list.
- **Using the Preview Window** Select an alphanumeric in the Unmapped Pins list and double click the pin in the decal preview window to map the alphanumeric to the pin. The next row in the Unmapped Pins list becomes the next selected alphanumeric for mapping.

**Tip** In the preview window, you can click and drag to define a zoom box, or use Shift+click or Shift+right-click to zoom in or out by a factor of two. You can zoom in up to 16X the original scale. The preview window will only zoom out to fit the decal entirely in the view.

• **Using a Spreadsheet Application** — Click **Copy Map** to copy both columns of the mapping table. Paste the mapping table into Excel. Make mass edits. Copy the data from Excel and click **Paste Map** on the **Pin Mapping** tab.

**Note:**

**Copy Map** and **Paste Map** only work with the whole pin mapping table and not selective rows.

- 7. Repeat as necessary.
- 8. When you have finished modifying the properties, click **OK** to save the changes.
