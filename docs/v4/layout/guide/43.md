### Recovering from a Fatal Error During File Open
If SailWind Layout crashes or displays a fatal error when you open a design, the design file may be corrupted. Before opening a Support Center service request, try to repair the file using the SailWind Router database integrity checking.

**Procedure**

- 1. Immediately after the fatal error occurs, create a new folder named *<design\_name>\_save,*  and copy the damaged design file and its backups (*Layout.pcb*, *Layou1.pcb*, *Layou2.pcb* and *Layou3.pcb*) to the new folder. (You may need to include these files as part of a Service Request.)
- 2. Open a standalone SailWind Router session, and open the damaged file. If the file does not open, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If the file opens, continue with Step 3.
- 3. Click **File** menu > **Save As**, and save the file under a different name, with the *.pcb* extension.
- 4. Close SailWind Router.
- 5. Open the new *.pcb* file in SailWind Layout. If the file does not open, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If the file opens, continue with the following step.
- 6. Export and re-import the design in ASCII format, as follows:
	- a. Click **File menu > Export**.
	- b. In the File Export dialog box, browse to an appropriate folder, name the new *.asc* file *<design\_name>\_ascii.asc*, and click **Save**.
	- c. In the ASCII Output dialog box,
		- i. Click **Select All**.
		- ii. Leave Expand Attributes unchecked.
- iii. From the Units list, select Basic.
- iv. Click OK.
- d. When the ASCII file is saved, click **File> New**. (If prompted, accept the default start-up file, and click No to the "Save old file" prompt.)
- e. Click **File> Import**.
- f. Browse to the *<design\_name>\_ascii.asc* file you just exported, select it, and click **Open**. If an *ascii.err* file is displayed Customer Support will need to review the design; open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If no *ascii.err*file is displayed, continue with Step 7.
- 7. Use one of the procedures described in Forward-Annotation of Design Changes from SailWind Logicto compare the netlists of this *.pcb* design and its associated schematic, and if necessary, update the *.pcb*. This restores any lost part or net connections to the *.pcb*.
- 8. The design is fixed; save the file as *<design\_name>\_fixed.pcb*.

### Recovering from a Fatal Error During Normal Operation
If SailWind Layout crashes or displays a fatal error during normal operation, the *.pcb* file may be corrupted. Before opening a Support Center service request, create copies of all files and run through some simple methods that may repair the design database.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot use this procedure to repair a design that fails to open. In that case, try to recover the file using the procedure in Recovering from a Fatal Error During File Open.

**Tip** Several files are created in the following procedure; the procedure specifies locations and names for these files in order to ensure that you work with the proper file in each step.

**Procedure**

- 1. Exit from the fatal error message. The design is saved to the backup file and closed.
- 2. Immediately create a new folder named *<design\_name>\_save,* and copy the damaged design file and its backups (*Layout.pcb*, *Layou1.pcb*,*Layou2.pcb* and *Layou3.pcb*) to the new folder. (You may need to include these files as part of a Service Request.)
- 3. Create another new folder named *<design\_name>\_repair* for the repair process files, and copy the damaged design file to the new folder as *<design\_name>\_bad.pcb*.
- 4. Restart SailWind Layout, and try to open *<design\_name>\_bad.pcb*. (Depending on the error, you may be able to open the file and continue.) If the file does not open, exit this procedure and use the procedure in Recovering from a Fatal Error During File Open. If the file opens, continue with Step 5.
- 5. Type the modeless command I and press the Enter key to run a database integrity check as described in Database Integrity Check During Normal Use.
- 6. Repeat the action that caused the error. If no errors/warnings appear, skip to Step 13. If errors/ warnings do appear, continue with Step 7.
- 7. Export and re-import the design in ASCII format, as follows:
	- a. Click **File menu > Export**.
	- b. In the File Export dialog box, browse to the *<design\_name>\_repair* folder, name the new *.asc*  file *ascii\_1.asc*, and click **Save**.
	- c. In the ASCII Output dialog box,
		- i. Click **Select All**.
		- ii. Leave Expand Attributes unchecked.
		- iii. From the Units list, select Basic.
		- iv. Click **OK**.
	- d. When the ASCII file is saved, click **File> New**. (If prompted, accept the default start-up file, and click No to the "Save old file" prompt.)
	- e. Click **File> Import**.
	- f. Browse to the *ascii\_1.asc* file you just exported, select it, and click **Open**. If an *ascii.err* file is displayed, exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If no *ascii.err* file is displayed, continue with Step 8.
- 8. Repeat the action that caused the error. If no errors/warnings appear, skip to Step 14. Otherwise, continue with Step 9.
- 9. Save the design as *<design\_name>\_1.pcb*, and close SailWind Layout.
- 10. Open and save the design in SailWind Router, as follows:
	- a. Start a standalone SailWind Router session, and open *<design\_name>\_1.pcb*. If the file does not open, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If the file opens, continue with step 10b.
	- b. Click **File menu > Save As, and save the file as <design\_name>\_2.pcb.**
	- c. Close SailWind Router.
- 11. Open *<design\_name>\_2.pcb* in SailWind Layout. If the file does not open, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If the file opens, continue with Step 12.
- 12. Repeat the action that caused the error. If errors/warnings still appear, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If no errors/warnings appear, continue with Step 13.
- 13. Export and re-import the design in ASCII format, as follows:

**a. Click File menu > Export.**

- b. In the File Export dialog box, browse to an appropriate folder, name the new *.asc* file *<design\_name>\_ascii.asc*, and click **Save**.
- c. In the ASCII Output dialog box,
	- i. Click **Select All**.
	- ii. Leave Expand Attributes unchecked.
	- iii. From the Units list, select Basic.
	- iv. Click OK.
- d. When the ASCII file is saved, click **File> New**. (If prompted, accept the default start-up file, and click No to the "Save old file" prompt.)
- e. Click **File> Import**.
- f. Browse to the *<design\_name>\_ascii.asc* file you just exported, select it, and click **Open**. If an *ascii.err* file is displayed, Customer Support will need to review the design; exit this procedure and open a new Support Center service request including the files you saved in *<design\_name>\_save*. If no *ascii.err* file is displayed, continue with Step 14.
- 14. Use one of the procedures described in "Forward-Annotation of Design Changes from SailWind Logic" to compare the netlists of this *.pcb* design and its associated schematic, and if necessary, update the *.pcb*. This restores any lost part or net connections to the *.pcb*.
- <span id="page-4-0"></span>15. The design is fixed; save the file as *<design\_name>\_fixed.pcb*.

### Database Integrity Check During Normal Use
When you run the database integrity check with the modeless command I, SailWind Layout verifies that the values in the design database are within an acceptable range. If problems are encountered, you are prompted to confirm an automatic database correction.

After you use the automatic correction routine to fix the errors, you should run a set of interactive checks on the new database. These interactive checks include, but are not limited to:

- Clearance checks
- Comparing netlists
- Continuity checks
- Tie plane check

For instructions on how to run these checks see "Verify the Design".

## Warning: Test Point Locked Dialog Box
A Warning dialog box appears when you modify vias, pins, or jumper pins that are locked test points, or clusters that contain test points, or routes that are connected to locked test points. The functions this warning dialog box performs vary, depending on whether you are modifying vias, pins, or routes.

The following topics discuss your options for handling locked test points during each of the following circumstances:

Modifying a Jumper Pin that is a Locked Test Point Modifying a Pin that is a Locked Test Point Modifying a Route Attached to a Locked Test Point Modification of a Via or Virtual Pin That is a Locked Test Point Move Sequential to Move Components, Unions, or Clusters with a Locked Test Point Moving, Dispersing, or Aligning a Component, Cluster, or Union with a Locked Test Point
