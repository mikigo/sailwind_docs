# Chapter 41 CAM Output
The following topics describe setup, preview and output for a printer, plotter, photoplotter, NC drill device and output files that are compatible with a variety of automatic assembly and pick-and-place machines.

You use the CAM command on the File menu to produce laser copy, plots, Gerber files, drill drawings, and other manufacturing outputs.

## CAM Documents
CAM is an acronym for Computer-Aided Manufacturing. Using the CAM tools, you can produce not only Gerber-formatted photoplot or manufacturing outputs, but printouts and plots as well.

A plot type, drill, silkscreen, or routing, together with an associated output device setup is called a CAM document.

There is no default set of output configurations when you start a new design - the Define CAM Documents dialog box is empty. Different types of designs require unique sets of output files. A design with 14 layers requires a larger set of output files than a design with only 2 layers. You must define your own list of output-document configurations which you require for each design. Your configurations can be saved within the *.pcb* file, so each file has its own CAM Documents list. You can export and then import your document configurations to reuse with a similar design.

When you add a CAM document, you are adding a preset output configuration, like a script, which you run against your design to create the type of output document required. The preset (CAM document) contains the Document Type, visible objects, design positioning, and output device.

When you have a list of document configurations in the Define CAM Documents dialog box, you can quickly run the configurations against your current design and create the outputs, whether they are printouts or photo plots or both. You can print documents singly or in batch mode.

You can use Import and Export to move a CAM documents list, including the aperture list and drill feed and speed table, between *.pcb* files.

**Note:**

You can create a maximum of 250 CAM Document configurations.

## Associated Copper and CAM
CAM interprets pads and other objects differently when they are associated with copper in the PCB Decal Editor.

For more information, see Associating Copper with Terminals. Associating copper shapes and open copper is one way to create hard breakouts in decals.

- Terminals are interpreted as vias.
- Closed copper shapes are interpreted as pads.
- Open copper (a path drawn with copper) is interpreted as a trace.

## RS-274-X Format
The RS-274-X format is based on the Gerber Format Guide (Document Number: 0000-00-RM-000, Part Number: 414-100-002) by Gerber Systems Corporation. RS-274-X in SailWind Layout is a data format created in CAM for photoplotters.

Clicking the RS-274-X output format from the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Boxcreates a Gerber file with the information shown in Table 133.



| Field   | Description          |  |  |
|---------|----------------------|--|--|
| AM      | Aperture macro       |  |  |
| AD      | Aperture description |  |  |
| FS      | Format statement     |  |  |
| MO      | Units mode           |  |  |
| IN      | Image name           |  |  |
| LN      | Layer name           |  |  |
| LP      | Layer polarity       |  |  |
| G36,G37 | Fill area controls   |  |  |

**Table 133. RS-274-X Fields**

These features are allowed for the 9500, 9800, 9900, GPC, and Insight/2020 photoplotters that also support the G74, G75 multiquadrant circular interpolation function codes. Some of these parameters appear in the Gerber file depending on photo plotter settings; however, the parameters in Table 134are always present in the Gerber file.

| The mode parameter           | Indicates the units, for example, %MOIN*% or %MOMM*%.                                                               |
| A format statement parameter | Describes the format options selected in the Photo Plotter<br>Advanced Setup Dialog Box, for example %FSLAX45Y45*%. |

**Table 134. Gerber File Fields**

**Aperture Table**

All simple apertures; such as round, oval, or rectangular; are described in the output Gerber file as a %ADDxx\*% parameter. The Photoplotter Aperture Report file is also created.

**Aperture Macro**

Copper areas associated with pins are output as unique aperture flashes.

Aperture support is as follows:

- Line-shaped polygonal copper with 50 vertexes or less and circular copper are supported.
- Line-shaped polygonal solid copper with 50 vertexes or less and circular solid copper are supported.
- Arc-shaped copper outlines are aperture macros in Gerber using polygonal approximation with up to 50 vertices. The %AM\*% parameter limits the number of vertices to 50.
- Thermal reliefs for CAM planes are output as macro flash.

SailWind Layout does not support copper cutouts for coppers associated with component pins.

SailWind Layout does not support hatched coppers associated with component pins. All associated coppers appear and output in CAM as solid, regardless of the grid spacing and line width.

**Fill Area**

Solid, not hatched, copper and copper planes are output in fill area mode (G36,G37 brackets). Hatched areas are output in vector format. Circular copper areas, arc-shaped polygons, and circular and polygonal copper cutouts are all supported.

**Verify Photoplots**

Verify Photoplots Document Type supports the macros, aperture selection, and fill area commands of SailWind Layout Gerber outputs. Verify Photoplots can only process RS-274-X Gerber files created by SailWind Layout.

## Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB

### Creating a Custom CAM Output
You can create a custom CAM output. This setting has no presets. You start with no default assigned layers or objects and choose which items to include in the output.

**Tip** If you use the TrueLayer option, see "TrueLayer Associations" for information on how TrueLayer affects layers and CAM documents.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name.

It is beneficial to add a description of your custom output in the document name. Type a document name that describes the plot type and output device; for example, Silkscreen Top Layer - to Print. If you were outputting this document to a file, this is not the filename to which it would be saved; you define that in the Output File box in a later step.

4. In the Document Type list, click Custom.

When you select a specific document type, the program automatically generates a pre-configured set of layers and items to plot. You can use these or customize them. You can view a summary of the settings of the default document type in the Summary box. If during your selection of a Document Type you are prompted to select a Layer Association and the layer does not exist in the list, you may need to revisit your Layers Setup. Click Set Layers for a shortcut to the Layers Setup Dialog Box; otherwise you would need to close all CAM dialog boxes to access the Setup menu.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you might send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and placement in the layer stackup.

6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in your output and then click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output.
8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
11. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
12. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the Device Setup as needed.
13. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_6_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

14. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

15. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
16. Click **Save**.

If you close the .pcb design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer.

### Creating a Set of CAM Documents Using Auto Define
You can quickly generate a set of CAM documents for your design using Auto Define. This feature uses a predefined group of default parameters to generate a "starter" set of CAM documents that you can further refine to meet your specific design requirements.

After using Auto Define to create your baseline CAM documents, you can edit each individual CAM document configuration to change the filename and modify the design object selections to meet your manufacturing output requirements. After the edits are complete, you can save and export the configurations for use in other designs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Auto Define only creates photoplot (*.pho*) files. You must manually create any additional types of CAM documents required by your design flow for printing or pen plotting.
- Auto Define uses a generic naming convention to identify each of the different CAM document file types (solder mask, paste mask, routing/plane layers, assembly drawing, drill file, and others). You can rename the files to reflect your specific naming preferences or corporate standards.
- Auto Define analyzes the design and creates separate drill files for plated-through holes, nonplated holes, and individual partial via drill pairs (if present in the design).
- Auto Define attempts to create a complete set of CAM documents based upon your specific design setup. It does not overwrite any existing CAM document configurations that you may have already created for the design. Auto Define detects and preserves any existing CAM document configurations and only appends the remaining missing files to the design.
- You cannot modify the default parameters used to auto-generate the CAM Document configurations; however, once created, you can edit and save your modified CAM document configurations, export them, and use them in other designs.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click the **Auto Define** button.

**Results**

The newly created CAM document configurations will appear in the CAM Documents area.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_7_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:**

Auto Define always attempts to generate a full set of CAM document configurations based upon your specific design setup. If you want to use Auto Define to create a subset of the CAM document configurations, run Auto Define to create the full set of CAM document configurations and then manually delete any unwanted CAM document configurations.

### Creating a Silkscreen Gerber-format File
You create the silkscreen gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the silkscreen top or silkscreen bottom layer.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Silkscreen Top, or Silkscreen Bottom.

4. In the Document Type list, click Silkscreen and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *silkscreen\_top.pho* or *silkscreen\_bottom.pho*.

6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the silkscreen data:
	- If all your silkscreen elements have been added to the Silkscreen layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- In a typical silkscreen, you want the Component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), as well as Ref. Des., and Outlines.
	- For large components, it is common to add attributes that add dots at pin 1 and numbers around the component to lessen the time it takes to locate a pin during testing or troubleshooting. If you have added such attributes on the Silkscreen layer, you should choose to display the Attributes from the Silkscreen layer.
	- Click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output.
8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_8_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Tip** It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design line up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

<sup>11.</sup> In the Suppress area, you can suppress the display of some Reference Designators.

**Tip** For example, if you have a set of mounting holes that use the Ref Des prefix X, you can choose not to include those reference designators in the silkscreen.

12. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
13. In the Output Device area, click the **Photo** button if not already selected.
14. Click **Device Setup** and in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
15. Click the **Advanced** button and in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You may want to use the RS-274X format.

16. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box.
17. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Setup dialog box.
18. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_9_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

19. Repeat these steps again to create the Silkscreen output for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
20. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
21. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
22. Click **Save**.

**Tip** If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Silkscreen preview, the black lines represent the silkscreen artwork. You should typically see component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), any board identification or version text, company logo, as well as Reference Designators outside the component outlines renumbered (from the original netlist import) into an easily search-able pattern.

You can use two sets of reference designators, one set on the silkscreen layers for the silkscreen artwork positioned outside the components where they will not be hidden after the component are placed and soldered onto the board, and the other set on the assembly drawing layers centered on components for the assembly drawing. If you have not built this second assembly drawing set of reference designators into your library decals, you can quickly add them to your design. For more information, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings".

### Creating a Solder Mask Gerber-format File
You create the solder mask gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the solder mask top, or solder mask bottom layer.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_10_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Note:** Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Solder Mask Top, or Solder Mask Bottom
4. In the Document Type list, click Solder Mask and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_10_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in theLayers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

**Tip** An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *soldermask\_top.pho* or *soldermask\_bottom.pho*.

6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the solder mask data:
- You need solder mask openings for each pad of each component and (optionally) each via.
	- If you have added these openings in the pad stacks, and all your solder mask elements have been added to the Solder Mask layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- If you have not added these openings in the pad stacks, there is an easy way to get the openings that you need without editing all the pad stacks. You can add the top layer to the Selected list and select the Pads check box for that layer. This adds openings the exact size of the pads in the solder mask. You will only need to oversize the Pads in the Plot Options.
- Click the Preview button to check what will be included in the output. When looking at the preview, the white area will be the solder mask. Black areas are openings in the solder mask.
8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
	-

**Tip** It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design line up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

11. In the Over(Under)size Pads By box, type a value if you need to globally modify the pad size openings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_11_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** If you are using the pad shapes of an outer layer to create the solder mask openings of the solder mask layer, you will probably want to add a global oversize here.

**Tip** If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Paste Mask preview keep in mind that, unlike solder mask, the paste mask is not an artwork layer - it is not a substance that is applied to the board. In this respect it is opposite to the solder mask layer. The black areas are in fact openings in the paste mask layer stencil and are the locations where the solder paste will be applied to the board. You should typically see paste mask openings (solder paste locations) for each pad of surface mounted components.

### Creating an Assembly Drawing
You create the assembly drawing for your manufacturer to reference when assembling the components on the board.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name such as Assembly Top, or Assembly Bottom
4. In the Document Type list, click Assembly and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose from the Top or Bottom side of the board.

The layers may not be named Top or Bottom, but will have the names you chose for the top and bottom layer of your design in the Layers Setup Dialog Box.

5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function. Name the file *assembly\_top.pho* or *assembly\_bottom.pho*.

6. If you need to create an assembly drawing of an assembly variant, do the following:

a. In the Customize Document area, click **Assembly**.
b. In the Select Assembly Variant dialog box, click the Use Assembly Variant check box to use an assembly variant as your design input for the assembly drawing.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_16_Picture_3.jpeg)

c. In the Name list, select a variant and click **OK**.
7. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the Device Setup as needed.

Typically, you would send the Assembly drawings to your printer, plotter or PDF file, and not output them to a gerber file. When you activate a printer or plotter as your output, you have the option to apply different colors to items in your output document. For example, you could include traces and pads in your assembly drawing using a lighter gray color while your component outlines and reference designators remained black. This could provide more context when manually assembling the board.

8. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
9. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the paste mask data:
	- You can add a set of reference designators to the assembly layers, and center those reference designators inside the component outline instead of using the silkscreen reference designators which will be scattered around the outside of components. This will make the assembly drawing easier to read. For the procedures, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings."
	- You may want to add the Part Types to the assembly drawing also.
	- If you have added markers in attributes to mark pin 1, it might be beneficial to add these to your assembly drawing.
	- If all your assembly elements have been added to the assembly layer, you can remove other layers in the Selected list.
	- Click the **Preview** button to check what will be included in the output.
10. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
11. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
12. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
13. In the Suppress area, you can suppress the display of some Reference Designators.

For example, if you have a set of mounting holes that use the Ref Des prefix X, you can choose not to include those reference designators in the assembly. They are not a true component and you do not need the assemblers to think it needs to be populated with a component.

14. For the assembly bottom drawing, you may want to select the Mirror Image check box to mirror the image.

15. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
16. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

17. Repeat these steps again to create the Assembly drawing for the opposite side of the board (if applicable).
18. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

19. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
20. Click **Save**.

If you close the *.pcb* design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer.

When looking at the Assembly Drawing preview, you typically see component outlines of the layer you are working on (Top Mounted or Bottom Mounted), as well as Reference Designators centered inside the component outlines renumbered (from the original netlist import) into an easily searchable pattern.

You use two sets of reference designators, one set on the assembly drawing layers centered on components for the assembly drawing, and the other set on the silkscreen layers for the silkscreen positioned outside the components where they will not be hidden after the component placement. If you have not built this second assembly drawing set of reference designators into your library decals, you can quickly add them to your design. For more information, see "Generating a Second Set of Reference Designators for Assembly Drawings"on page 808.

### Creating a Routing/Split Plane Gerber-format File
Conductive element layers are separated into two types of outputs. Your layers are either routing/ split plane layers, or CAM plane layers. You create the routing/split plane gerber-format file for your manufacturer's photo plotter to produce the conductive layer of your PCB.

**Prerequisites**

- Before you actually create the gerber-format file for this conductive layer, you must ensure that all copper planes are flooded and filled with copper.
- Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a Document Name.

It is beneficial to add not only the usage of the layer in the name, but also the placement of the layer in the board layer stackup. For example, Signal 2 - L6.

4. In the Document Type list, click Routing/Split Plane and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose your layer from the available layers.
5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and placement in the layer stackup.

6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the silkscreen data:
	- In a typical conductive elements output, you want all the conductive elements of one layer. You probably want Pads, Traces, Vias, Copper, and associated pin copper if it exists.
	- If you add drafting elements to this layer, like lines or text, they will be manufactured as copper. You might want to move these items to the silkscreen layer.
	- Click the **Preview** button to check what will be included in the output.
8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

**Tip**

It is important that each gerber-format file that you output for your design lines up exactly with the others. You must use the same Positioning settings for each layer and you must ensure that objects on one layer are not offsetting the layer from the Justification setting. For example, you have chosen to justify the layers by the Top Left, and you have decided to include the board outline in all your outputs. The board outline will be justified at the top left of each output, but if you have a component that extends outside the board outline on the left side of the board, it is possible that your silkscreen layer will not be aligned to the other layers you have created, since the alignment is to the component outline on the left (and the board outline at the top).

11. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
12. In the Output Device area, click the **Photo** button if not already selected.
13. Click **Device Setup** and in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.
14. Click the **Advanced** button and in the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup Dialog Box, make any necessary changes to the settings.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_19_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** You may want to use the RS-274X format.

15. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Advanced Setup dialog box.
16. Click **OK** to close the Photo Plotter Setup dialog box.
17. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_19_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Tip** While you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, you probably want to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in case you need to generate the file again.

18. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.
19. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.

| P | ( |
|---|---|
|   | I |

**CAUTION:** If your design has copper planes that are not filled with copper, you must fill the areas before creating the gerber-format outputs. You will be prompted to fill them in order to create the output file.

20. Click **Save**. If you close the *.pcb* design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the Routing/Split Plane preview, you typically see in black - only the copper items located on the selected layer - all traces, vias, copper, copper planes. If this is a component layer, you will also see all the component pads and associated pin copper if it exists. The white areas are areas of no copper.

4. In the Document Type list, click CAM Plane and in the Layer Association Dialog Boxthat appears, choose your layer from the available layers.
5. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

An autogenerated name appears in the Output File box. This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and placement in the layer stackup.

6. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.
7. In the Select Items Dialog Box, choose which layers and layer items should appear in the silkscreen data:
	- In a typical CAM plane output, you probably want Pads, Vias, and Copper. Since this is a negative image plane, copper objects will show up as a cutout in the CAM Plane.
	- If you add drafting elements to this layer, like lines or text, they will be manufactured as copper. You might want to move these items to the silkscreen layer.

• Click the **Preview** button to check what will be included in the output.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** CAM Planes are negative images in the work area and also in the CAM Preview. When viewing a routing/split plane layer document type the white areas are openings in the copper, but when viewing a CAM (negative) plane, the white area is copper.

8. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
9. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
10. In the Plot Options Dialog Box, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory or a subdirectory if you created one.

When looking at the CAM Plane preview, you see a negative image (opposite image) compared to the Routing/Split Plane layers. The white area is the copper and the black objects - typically only vias or through hole pin locations are areas of no copper. Since this is a negative image, you place copper on this layer to create a copper void (an area of no copper). You should see these voids if you have used them.

CAM plane thermals are displayed in the CAM Preview dialog box (and in the Layout editor). The following calculations are also used for resulting output during printing, pen plotting, and RS-274-X photoplotting operations:

- The outer diameter of the thermal matches the width of the aperture set in the Photo Plotter Setup Dialog Box.
- The inner diameter is 75% of the outer diameter.
- The number of spokes is always four, arranged diagonally.
- The spoke width is 1/6 of the outer diameter.

**Tip** The inner width for custom CAM plane thermals is set as the pad size defined in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box. The outer width is set as the default same-net pad to corner rule.

### Creating a Drill Drawing with Drill Table
You can create a drill drawing for one or more drill pairs.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

The drill chart is only output in the drill drawing CAM document. It is not embedded in the design.

**Procedure**

1. Choose the **File > CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click **Drill Symbols** to open the "Global Drill Symbols dialog box"on page 1387 to define your drill symbols.
3. If using partial vias, select the **Unique Through/Partial column** check box to allow filtering of the drill holes.

Selecting this check box displays the Through/Partial column in the table to differentiate partial from through-hole drills.

4. If necessary, click **Regenerate** to update the table data.

Populate data in the drill drawing table by manually adding entries or by gathering information from the design database by clicking **Augment** or **Regenerate**. If you have not saved any new default settings and if no data previously existed in the table, clicking **Augment** or **Regenerate** populates the table in ascending order of size and then plated holes before non-plated holes.

5. Customize the settings of the Drill data as needed.
	- Customize the text size.
	- Modify the symbols used and Tolerance. For more information, see "Modifying Drill Table Entries"on page 963.
	- Sort the data in the drill drawing table by clicking the column header of drill size, quantity of the holes, or plating type. For more information, see "Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table" on  page 962.
6. Click **OK** to close the Global Drill Symbols dialog box.
7. In the Define CAM Documents dialog box, click **Add**.
8. In the Add Document dialog boxon page 1044, type a name in the Document Name box.

It is beneficial to add not only the usage of the file in the name, but also the drill pair if using partial vias. For example, Drill Drawing L1-3.

9. From the Document Type dropdown list, select "Drill Drawing" and then, in the "Layer Association dialog box"on page 1437 that appears, choose one of the layers in your drill pair and click **OK**.

If you are only using through hole vias, any layer will do. If you want to display the drill holes of multiple drill pairs in the same drawing, select one of the layers in your drill pair. You will add additional layers in a later step.

10. In the Output File box, type a name for the file you are creating.

(An auto-generated name appears in the Output File box but you can overwrite it.) This is the name of the file you will send to the manufacturer. Your manufacturer will find it helpful if this filename is related to its function and the drill pair it represents.

11. In the Customize Document area, click the **Layers** button.

12. In the "Select Items dialog box"on page 954, choose which layers to include, and check for these conditions:

**CAUTION:**

The objects that require drilling must be added to the drill drawing in order for the drill chart to be created. The chart only displays the drill data of items that are added to the drill drawing in the Select Items dialog boxon page 1699. For example, if no pads or vias are added from the electrical layers, the chart will not display drill information for those locations.

- If you have added dimensions to the Drill Drawing layer, you must enable Lines and Text.
- For designs that only use through holes, you only need to include one electrical layer. For designs that use partial vias, you need to add at least one layer that the partial via starts on, passes through, or ends on. Even though a layer of each drill pair appears in the list, you can use the Drill Drawing Options to restrict the drill holes that appear in the drawing.
- Click the **Preview** button to see what will be included in the output.
13. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the Select Items dialog box.
14. In the Customize Document area, click **Options**.
15. In the "Plot Options dialog box"on page 1641, in the Positioning area, set the positioning options.
16. In the Drill Chart area, type new coordinates for the Location of the chart if necessary.

In the Preview window, notice the position of the magenta-colored rectangle with respect to the position of your board outline. This is the current location of the drill chart in the drill drawing. Determine where to position the drill chart with reference to the design origin.

17. Click the **Drill Symbols** button and in the "Drill Symbols dialog box"on page 1334, select the "Use" check box for each drill symbol that you want to include in the drawing; then click **OK**.
18. Check your location of the Drill Chart in the Preview window and if needed, edit the location of the drill chart.
19. Click **OK** to close the Plot Options dialog box.
20. In the Output Device area, choose the device and update the device setup as needed.
21. Click **OK** to add the new file configuration to the "Define CAM Documents dialog box"on page 1261.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_25_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** Although you can click **Run** and create the output file from the Add Document dialog box, the recommended course is to click **OK** to add this configuration to the Define CAM Documents dialog box in the event you need to generate the file again.

22. In the CAM Directory list, choose the folder where you want to save the output files.

You can skip this step if you are sending it to your printer.

23. Select the document(s) you want to output in the Document name list, and then click **Run**.
24. Click **Save**. If you close the design without saving the design, you will lose any additions to the Define CAM Documents dialog box.

**Results**

Your file(s) appear in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Cam* directory (or a subdirectory if you created one) if you are not sending the output to your printer. In addition, the Drill Drawing preview displays drill locations with markers and a drill chart listing all the drill sizes, based on your assignments in the Global Drill Symbols dialog box and the set design unit options (mils, metric, or inches). Dimensioning measurements for the board may also display on the drawing.

### Verifying a Gerber File
Use Verify Photo to open *.pho* (gerber) files for viewing.

The Verify Photo is more than just a Preview, it looks at the actual Gerber output for its data, rather than taking data from the PCB file before the actual photoplot is generated. This allows you to create a hardcopy paper printout of your Gerber files to perform visual inspections and keep records of your plot files.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. In the Define CAM Documents Dialog Box, click **Add**.
3. In the Document Type list, click Verify Photo.
4. In the Photo plotter output file name dialog box, browse for the gerber file.
5. Select the gerber file and click **Open**. The path to the file appears in the Summary area.
6. Click the **Preview Selections** button.
7. View your gerber file in the CAM Preview window.

Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB

### Creating All Outputs
You can run multiple CAM document configurations against your current design.

**Procedure**

1. Select a document configuration in the CAM Documents list.

You can also drag or Shift+click to select multiple adjacent documents. Select multiple nonadjacent documents using Ctrl+click.

2. Click **Run**.

**Results**

A prompt window verifies the list of documents to be created. The generated CAM outputs are send to print or plot or are written to a file in the CAM Directory.

When you run CAM on a layer that is specified as a mixed plane in the Layers Setup Dialog Box, the message "Split/mixed plane detected. Perform flood and DRC checks?" appears. This message appears only once when running CAM on multiple split/mixed plane layers.

- Click **Yes** to run the flood operation on the split/mixed plane, perform a Plane Check of Verify the Design, and generate split/mixed plane data for the layer. The Plane Check is run using the options of the Mixed Plane Setup Dialog Box.
- Click **No** to cancel the process. You can run Plane Check from Verify Design manually for more information on the errors.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_27_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Note:**

CAM interprets pads and other objects differently when they are associated with copper in the PCB Decal Editor. For more information, see the Pins with Associated Copper area of the "Select Items Dialog Box".

**Tip** For color print outputs, if text is combined with a 2D line or part of a dimension line, then a grayscale or preset color will be used for line items. Any free text on the board will use what is assigned for text in the Select Items dialog box.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_27_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Note:**

Virtual pins in the design are output as vias.

## Creating Reusable Fabrication Notes
You can save your fabrications notes to the library for reuse.

**Procedure**

1. Create the individual line items of text.

For more information, see "Adding Free Text".

2. Since text alone cannot be saved to the library, add an underline to the heading of your fab notes using a 2D Line.

For more information, see "Creating a Drafting Object".

3. Combine all the text with the line item.

For more information, see "Combining Line and Text Objects".

4. Save your notes to a library.

For more information, see "Saving a Drafting Item to a Library".

## Reporting Apertures of a Photo-Plot File(s)
You can produce a report of the apertures used in a CAM Document.

**Prerequisites**

To produce an aperture report, you must have run the CAM Document(s) photo plot configuration against your design. If the CAM Document is set to print, or pen output, it will not produce the report.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM** menu item.
2. Select a CAM document in the CAM Documents list.
3. Click **Aperture Report**.
4. In the Aperture report file name dialog box, type a name for the report and then click **Save**.

**Results**

<span id="page-28-1"></span>The aperture report opens in the default text editor.

## TrueLayer Associations
By default, when you flip a component, the component attributes flip with it. For example, you flip a component from one side to the other in the design.

Although the reference designator attribute is visible and located on the top silkscreen layer, it automatically flips to the bottom silkscreen layer. You are using TrueLayer association. This feature also depends on you associating layers correctly in the Layer Setup. You can override the TrueLayer functionality by applying a command line switch to the software on startup.

<span id="page-28-2"></span>For more information, see "Software Launch Options".

## Colors in CAM Documents
You can apply colors to CAM document objects if you are outputting to a printer or a pen plotter.

![](/layout/guide/41/_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

The color palette only shows colors that the printer or plotter can output. If your device can only print grayscale, the palette will show grayscale. For monochrome output devices (printers/ plotters), the only color available is black.

**Colors of Objects**

You can assign a color to the object types for printing.

• In the Select Items Dialog Box, in the Selected Color area, click a color in the palette and click the box beside a design object. You must select the check box of a design object before the object color swatch appears.

**Colors of Individual Nets**

You can use the colors you have assigned to nets in the View Nets dialog box when you print.

• In the Select Items Dialog Box, select the Color By Net check box to use the View Nets colors in the output.

## Applying the Over(Under)size Value to All Layers
You can extend the value of the Over(Under)Size value to non-electrical layers using an attribute applied to the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy.

In PADS2007.1 or later, the attribute is automatically added to all designs when opening the design or when importing an ASCII file. Opened designs, created with version PADS2007 have the attribute value set to No to only apply the Over(Under)size value to electrical layers.

Opened designs created with any other version have the attribute set to Yes to apply the Over(Under)size value to all layers.

**Procedure**

1. In the design, select an object (for example, a component, component pad, or net), right-click and click the **Attribute** popup menu item.
2. In the "Attributes for" list, click PCB.

**Tip** This displays any attribute of the PCB at the PCB level of the attribute hierarchy.

3. The "CAM.Apply Oversize To All Pads" attribute appears in the attribute list.
4. Use an attribute value of Yes to apply the Over(Under)size value to all layers or use No to accept the default of applying the value only to electrical layers.

**Results**

- Is the Over(Under)size value not being applied correctly? There is a hierarchy of settings that apply to Solder Mask and Paste Mask layers, and the Over(Under)size value has the lowest priority. For more information, see "Control of Solder Mask and Paste Mask".
- Is the attribute not listed when viewing the PCB attributes at the PCB level of the hierarchy? Add the attribute with the correct value.

## Drill Drawing Options
Use the Drill Drawing Options dialog box to set drill drawing legend and marker parameters.

Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table Modifying Drill Table Entries

### Sorting the Data in the Drill Drawing Table
You can populate and then sort the data in the drill drawing table by drill size or quantity of the holes, and then by plating type.

**Tip**

Populate data in the drill drawing table by manually adding entries or by gathering information from the design database with **Augment** or **Regenerate**. If you have not saved any new default settings and if no data previously existed in the table, **Augment** or **Regenerate** populates the table in ascending order of size and then plated holes before non-plated holes.

**Procedure**

1. Click on the appropriate column (Size, Quantity, or Plated) in the drill drawing table.
2. Click another column heading (Size, Quantity, or Plated) to also sort by that column.

**Results**

The final sorting order is determined by the order in which the columns are selected for sorting.

For example, clicking the Size column first determines whether the data appears in numerical ascending or descending order. If you then click the Plated column, the list is reordered with plated or non-plated holes first while maintaining the ascending or descending numerical sorting order that you previously selected. If you then click the Quantity column, the Quantity sorting order overrides the previous selections.

**Examples**

The sorting results are formatted to correspond with the filters you have chosen.

Table 135shows the result of a sort by size (ascending order) and then by plated type.

<span id="page-31-2"></span>

| Symbol    | Size          | Quantity | Plated | Tolerance     |
|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| +         | 0.0135        | 35       | Yes    | +0.000/0.0135 |
| X         | 0.02          | 125      | Yes    | +/-0.003      |
| Rectangle | 0.037         | 62       | Yes    | +/-0.003      |
| Diamond   | 0.048 X 1.020 | 44       | Yes    | +/-0.003      |

**Table 135. Example Sort Result**

| Symbol      | Size  | Quantity | Plated | Tolerance     |
|-------------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Rectangle + | 0.056 | 8        | Yes    | +/-0.003      |
| Rectangle X | 0.072 | 4        | Yes    | +/-0.003      |
| Diamond +   | 0.11  | 6        | No     | +/-0.005      |
| Circle +    | 0.156 | 4        | No     | +0.005/-0.002 |

**Table 135. Example Sort Result(continued)**

### Modifying Drill Table Entries
You can modify the drill table entries shown in the Drill Data area.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Symbol usage is exclusive you cannot save your changes if you create duplicate symbol assignments.
- You cannot edit data in the Size, Quantity, or Plated columns.

**Procedure**

1. To modify the symbol associated with a specific drill entry, double-click the target symbol entry in the Symbol column and select a symbol from the list of available drill symbols.

The next time you click on the entry, the symbol preview window in the Drill Symbol Markers area reflects the symbol change.

2. To specify or change the tolerance value for a specific drill entry, double-click the target tolerance entry in the Tolerance column and type a tolerance value.

**Tip** The Tolerance column gives you the flexibility of entering a text string of up to 32 characters, which enables you to add a fabrication note along with your tolerance value. As a general rule, be careful to type suitable tolerance values. You can copy and paste tolerance data between text fields, but you cannot perform multiple cell copy functions.

## Assembly Variants
Assembly Variants allow you to create multiple versions of your assembly containing component substitutions and/or omissions. This allows one base design to support multiple product configurations at assembly time.

Substitute a Component for Assembly Variants Creation of Assembly Variants

### Substitute a Component for Assembly Variants
The Variant/Substitute dialog box appears when you choose to substitute a component in an assembly variant. When you substitute a component, the substitution is referred to as the active component. The original component that you substituted is referred to as the default. The default component is what exists in the base option and the raw database.

## CAM Plus Assembly Machine Interface
The CAM Plus command generates computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) output files that are compatible with a variety of automatic assembly and pick-and-place machines. Supported formats include Dynapert, Siemens, Universal, and Quad.

Batch Mode and Masked Mode Running CAM Plus CAM Plus Report File Names

### Batch Mode and Masked Mode
CAM Plus uses the *part.def* file differently depending on whether you click Masked in the Parts list in conjunction with Batch Part Definition File.

- With Masked selected and the Batch Part Def File check box selected, CAM Plus sorts parts to all machines as defined in the *part.def*file, ignoring non-defined parts, Part D.
- With Masked selected, the Batch Part Def File check box cleared, and a specific machine selected, CAM Plus sorts only parts defined in *part.def* as assigned to that machine.
- With something other than Masked selected and the Batch Part Def File check box selected, CAM Plus sorts parts assigned in **part.def** to their respective machines, but includes undefined parts in files for all machines.
- With something other than Masked selected, the Batch Part Def File check box cleared, and a specific machine selected, CAM Plus sends all parts to the selected machine.

### Running CAM Plus
You can set up CAM Plus to generate machine-specific output files.

**Prerequisites**

You must manually create a *part.def* file in order to use the CAM Plus option. Every part that is used in the design must be listed in the *part.def* file. This may require assistance from manufacturing engineering to determine which parts to insert by which machines, and to set standard bin assignments. Also, place all design components at their final locations before you start CAM Plus. By default, the part definition file is read from the *\Libraries* folder. For more information, see Part Definition File Format.

**Procedure**

1. Click the **File> CAM Plus** menu item.
2. In the Part Definition Filename box, type *part.def*. The file is read from the *\Libraries* folder by default.
3. In the Setup area:
a. Select a side of the board from the Side list.
b. Select the type of parts to include in the report from the Parts list.

Choose from SMT, ThruPin, All, and Masked. Masked parts are those that are assigned to the machine selected format as an insert class.

c. Select the Read Part Definition check box to add the additional information contained in the Part Definition File, *part.def*, to the parts contained in a design.

This information defines the insertion class for all parts. Read Part Definition scans the Part Definition File for information about the parts in the database. When an exact match is found between a part type name in the database and a part type name in the definition file, the information combines to provide the manufacturing output.

d. Select the Read Value Definition check box to read the Value attributes for each part in the SailWind Layout design and append the Value attribute to the part type name when matching each part type in the Part Definitions file, *part.def*.

For example, an R1/4W part type with Value attribute 100K could have an entry in the Part Definitions file as follows: R1/4W{100K},ins=un6241,bodydiam=200,leaddiam=30,anvil=2

e. Select the Verify File check box to produce an ASCII verification file.

This ASCII file is stored in the *\SailWind Projects\Cam\<board\_file\_name>* folder. This file contains 2D line data that describes the path for the inserted parts. The name of the file is the name of the interface program created, with the *.asc* extension. You can read this file into SailWind Layout with the ASCII In command. It states the insertion path as 2D lines on layer 19. If a Part\_Num value for a part is not found, Part\_Num is set to Missing.

f. Select the Batch Part Def. File check box to run all of the outputs with a single command.

For each program you run, an output file is produced with the name suffix bt or bb, for example *dym318bt.smt* or *6241bb.put*. If this file already exists, the message "Overwrite existing file (Y/N)?" appears. Click either Yes or No. If you click Yes, the file is overwritten and placed in the CAM subfolder. Each of the parts in the selected category is added to the file. A report called*insert.lst* lists each part and the machine that inserts it. The Batch command does not create a Verify file.

4. In the Geometry area:
	a. Type a value for the Board Offsets to define the offset of the machine's location dowel with regard to the 0,0 system origin board.

These offset values convert the design coordinates to the machine origin. Allowable values are from 0 to 10 inches. Offset values are in inches; for example, 1250 is 1.25 inches. You may need to define a new Board offset for each machine.

b. Type values for the Step/Repeat values to define whether to treat the board as a single design when creating the output program file, or to insert a number of boards simultaneously.

When you insert a number of boards, you can define the number of steps in the X and Y direction and the step and repeat interval to use, as shown in the table below. CAM Plus uses current design units for the offset and step and repeat values. Each machine has its own units type to which the data is always converted regardless of the current design units. CAM Plus generates assembly program files for inserting parts on all boards.

| Option  | Description                                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X Count | Number of copies in X direction. The maximum is 20.                                                 |
| Y Count | Number of copies in Y direction. The maximum is 20.                                                 |
| X Step  | The step distance in the X direction between the origin of each board. The<br>maximum is 10 inches. |
| Y Step  | The step distance in the Y direction between the origin of each board. The<br>maximum is 10 inches. |

**Table 136. X and Y Step and Count Options**

The default is no step and repeat, equivalent to a step of 1 in X and Y.

5. In the Output Format list, select the machine format.

Files are produced for all parts of a selected class: masked, through hole, SMT, top, bottom, and so on. All parts in the class are included in this output file, whether or not their insert class is defined as belonging to the specific machine.

6. In the Universal Tooling and Universal Axial Output lists select the desired settings if applicable.

| Note: |
|-------|
|       |

Universal-specific instructions are available when you select Universal machine formats or check Batch Part Def. File.

**7. Click Run.**

8. Examine the Status Messages box for the current state of output.
9. Navigate to *C:\PadsProjects\CAM\Newfolder(Design Name)\* to examine the output file. CAM Plus produces and prints error messages in the file *padscim.err*.

### CAM Plus Report File Names
The file names created by CAM Plus for various insertion machines are formatted with a prefix name of the machine and a suffix of the components selected.

The prefix for each machine type is shown under the heading for each machine in the CAM Plus Supported Machine Formats. The last two characters in the output file name (shown as xx) are determined by the components selected.

CAM350 is a pre-production CAM system that combines DFM analysis, DRC checking, test fixturing, planning, and tooling. The CAM350 products range from Gerber viewers to full-featured CAM editors that process PCB databases into usable fabrication and panel data.

CAM350 lets you analyze your design for manufacturing issues prior to fabrication, drastically reducing cycle time and cost. The tools are based on a fully-intelligent CAD database and can input and output virtually any Gerber format, IPC-D-350/IPC-D-356 data, CAD database, or netlist.

**CAM350 Link**

CAM350 Link is a SailWind Layout option that automatically translates a design database into a CAM350 (version 6.0 and greater) database. You no longer need to generate an ASCII file for translation; CAM350 Link uses the native SailWind Layout file format and adds a *.cam* extension. In addition to converting designs for translation, you can launch CAM350 and load the current database directly from the CAM350 dialog box.

CAM350 Link also supports backward annotation of Design For Manufacture (DFM) errors to a SailWind Layout database so that you can identify and correct DFM errors in SailWind Layout instead of making the corrections in CAM350.

See the "Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB" topic for information on outputting CAM documents from SailWind Layout. See the DFF Audit Process Flow using CAM350 Linktopic for information on CAM350 Link procedures.

**CAM350 Link Non-Supported Objects**

Some design objects are not passed from SailWind Layout to CAM350 during CAM350 Link translation when translating a CAM document with nets and when translating CAD layers to CAM layers.

These specific design objects are:

- Associated pin copper is merged into a single layer custom aperture. Associated pin copper is always merged to the pad layer during translation to CAM350. The result is that associated copper is not handled on layers other than the pad layer. In addition, associated copper is not distinguished from pad flashes.
- Combined text is not output with owning lines in CAM documents. When combined text and lines are translated to CAM350, combined text visibility is controlled by text visibility in the CAM document itself, not by the line visibility in the CAM document settings.
- The pad oversize option in the CAM documents is not supported when translating to CAM350.
- Hatched copper is not supported for PADS-format ASCII import. Hatched copper is converted to solid fill copper rather than hatched copper when translating to CAM350.
- Decal lines and text on the Top or Bottom electrical layers are not distinguished from lines and text for Top or Bottom silkscreen layers. Decal lines and text from the Top and Bottom electrical layers are moved to silkscreen layers during CAM350 translation. Visibility control for Top and Bottom lines and text can not be distinguished from visibility control for silkscreen lines and text.
- Jumper reference designators and outlines are moved to silkscreen layer. Jumper reference designators are converted to free text and jumper outlines are converted to lines in CAM350. Jumper reference designators and outlines are also moved to the silkscreen layer during translation.

The CAM350 Analysis feature reports jumpers as net connectivity errors. CAM350 does not support CAM negative planes on outer mounting layers. CAM350 does not support a layer type of negative plane for outer mounting layers.

**Test Points in CAM350**

Test points in CAM350 are used for Bed of Nails testing or Flying Probe in-circuit testing. Test points in SailWind Layout are used for in-circuit testing using fixtures. Although the test configurations and rule data are similar, there is no direct mapping between SailWind Layout test point configuration data and CAM350 configuration data.

However, test point status is passed to CAM350 for information purposes. The test point status and the access side are translated from the ASCII file to the CAM350 database.

Test point configuration data and clearance rules are not passed to CAM350 from SailWind Layout.

Probe sizes are not passed to CAM350. Only the test point location and probe side are passed.

**CAM350 Link Document Conversion**

SailWind Layout CAM documents combine layer and data type specifications for output in a CAM photoplot file. A new layer is created in the CAM350 file for each SailWind Layout CAM document.

For more information on CAM documents see the "Creating CAM Outputs to Manufacture Your PCB" topic.

CAM documents can be arbitrarily named. These arbitrary names are used for layer names in the CAM350 database to hold the CAM document content. The CAM350 Link extracts the SailWind Layout data types from the PADS-format ASCII file for the layers specified in the MISC CAM section of the ASCII file. The resulting layers in the CAM350 database match the content of the Gerber photoplot file generated by SailWind Layout CAM operations.

**Tip** CAM document names are truncated to 16 characters due to the maximum file name length in CAM350.

Supported CAM documents for CAM350 Link include the following five types:

- Plane: ground plane (pads, vias, copper, lines, text)
- Routing: top (pads, vias, tracks, copper, lines, text)
- Silkscreen: (outline top)
	- top: (ref. des., part type)
	- silkscreen top: (lines, text, outlines)
- Paste mask:
	- top: (pads)
	- paste mask top: (copper, lines, text)
- Solder mask:
	- top: (pads, test points)
	- solder mask top: (copper, lines, text, test points)
