# Printing and Plotting Schematics Tutorial
This lesson demonstrates how to print schematics in SailWind Logic.

****In this lesson:****

- Choosing what appears in the printout
- Setting plot orientation and printing

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic and open the file named **preview.sch** found in \ SailWind Projects\Samples.

## Choosing what appears in the printout
All items in the plot of a schematic sheet can be enabled or disabled for printing.

- 1. **File** menu > **Print**.
- 2. In the Print dialog box, click **Options**.
- 3. Ensure that both sheets in the design are in the Sheets to Print list. If not, click **Add All**. They are selected for plotting.
- 4. Clear the **Part Text** check box. This removes the pin names from all the parts in the plot.

## Setting plot orientation and printing
Check the plot orientation for optimal coverage of your printed page. In the Options dialog box, the Preview area displays the current orientation setting of your printer. The white area represents your page, while the blue box represents the schematic and how it will display on your printed sheet.

- 1. In the Positioning group box, switch the **Orientation** options until the blue box best fits the sheet, and click **OK**.
- 2. Set up your printer as usual and click **OK**.
- 3. Do not save a copy of the file.
