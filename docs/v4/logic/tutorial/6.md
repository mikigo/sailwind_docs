# Adding Buses Tutorial
Buses are used to quickly add connections for a collection of sequentially named nets, such as an address or data bus.

****In this lesson:****

Creating and connecting a bus

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic and open the file named **previewconnect.sch** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

## Creating and connecting a bus
In the following sections you will add a bus and connect U7 to the bus (in dashed lines in the graphic below). Buses are used to streamline net connections in a schematic for easy readability. Nets that commonly connect from one component to another are "merged" into a bus to make viewing of schematic connections clearer.

****Create a bus****

Create new buses by using the Add Bus command.

- 1. Click the **Add Bus** button on the Design toolbar.
- 2. Using the coordinate display on the Status Bar as a reference, position the pointer at **X9400**, **Y4400**.
- 3. Position the pointer at **X8100**, **Y6200** and double-click, or right-click and click **Complete** to complete the definition of the bus.
- 4. In the Add Bus dialog box, click **Bit Format**.
- 5. In the Bus Name box, type **D[00:07]** to name the bus and click **OK**. The bus name label attaches to the pointer.
- 6. Position the label just above the horizontal segment of the bus and click to place it.
- 7. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit Add Bus mode.

****Bus naming conventions****

The bus labeled in this exercise uses the Bit Format – a series of nets with consecutive net names. A Mixed Net bus type consists of individual nets that are not always sequential. It can even include a bit format bus along with other nets. Mixed Nets are added individually to the Bus Nets list in the Add Bus dialog box. A bit range for each net is optional.

****Connect to a bus****

Connect to a bus using the Add Connection command.

- 1. Add Connection button **.**
- 2. Select pin number **12** on U7, and position the pointer over the vertical segment of the bus.
- 3. Click to add a connection to the bus.
- 4. In the Add Bus Net Name dialog box, click **OK** to accept the D00 net name.
- 5. Right-click and click **Move**.
- 6. Position the net name label over the connection, and click to place it.
- 7. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to connect pin number **13** on U7 to D01. **Result:** The net name assignment automatically increments, and the position of the net name label is preserved.
- 8. Click to accept the position of the D01 net name.
- 9. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit the Add Mode. **Alternative:** Press Esc.

****Use duplicate to step and repeat bus connections****

You can use the Duplicate command to step and repeat connections and speed the process of connecting to a bus.

- 1. Duplicate Mode button **.**
- 2. Select the midpoint of the D01 connection you added. **Result:** A copy of the connection attaches to the pointer.
- 3. Right-click and click **Step and Repeat**.
- 4. In the Step and Repeat dialog box, select **Down** as the direction, type **6** in the Count box, and type **100** in the Distance box.
- 5. Click **OK** to complete the connection of U7 to the data bus.
- 6. Press **Esc** twice to cancel and exit first Duplicate Mode and then Add Connection Mode.

****Rename a bus, subnet, or net****

You can rename a bus, subnets of a bus, or nets.

- 1. **Right-click** > **Select Anything** > select a connection (or bus) segment > **right-click** > **Properties**.
- 2. Change the name of the net or bus by typing a new name in the Net Name box or by switching to another net in the list.
- 3. Choose a Rename option to set how the rename is applied to the selected connection. There are two options:
	- **This Instance –** affects only the selected connection
	- **All Instances** every connection instance of the named net in the design
- 4. Click **OK** to apply the rename.

**Tip:** When you change a netname to a netname that already exists, you are prompted to confirm the combining of the nets. Click OK to combine the two nets into one net.

5. Do not save a copy of the file.
