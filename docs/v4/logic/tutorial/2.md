# Learning the User Interface Tutorial

The SailWind Logic user interface is designed for ease-of-use and efficiency. SailWind Logic is designed to meet the needs of the power user, while keeping the beginner in mind. SailWind Logic's interface and interaction are similar to other Windowsâ„¢ applications. You can interact with SailWind Logic using the keyboard, menus, toolbars, and shortcut menus.

****In this lesson:****

- Keyboard command shortcuts
- Using the workspace
- Panning and zooming
- Selecting objects

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic, and click File > New.

## Keyboard command shortcuts
You can use keyboard shortcuts to start commonly used commands or to set options. You will use some of the shortcuts throughout the tutorial.

****Keyboard shortcut types:****

| Type of shortcut  | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modeless Commands | Commands invoked through the keyboard. The available<br>commands handle display options, design settings, and<br>mouse click substitutions.                 |
| Shortcut Keys     | Commands that change settings or execute commands<br>without using the mouse. Windows shortcut keys, such<br>as Alt+F to open the File menu, are also used. |

## Using the workspace
The default workspace measures 56 inches by 56 inches. The origin of the workspace, or 0,0 coordinate location, is represented by a large white marker. When you start SailWind Logic or open a new file, the origin is located at the lower-left corner of the sheet, at a medium magnification. The large white rectangle represents the area of the workspace occupied by the schematic sheet. For a size B schematic the area is 11 x 17. For a size C sheet it is 17 x 22, and so on.

****Pointer position display****

As you move the pointer around the workspace, its position, in absolute X,Y coordinates relative to the origin, appears on the Status Bar at the lower right corner of the screen. Throughout this tutorial you will refer to this coordinate data.

- 1. Place the pointer over the origin point and note the 0,0 reading on the Status Bar.
- 2. Move the pointer around the workspace and note how the X,Y coordinates change as the pointer position changes.

****Set the sheet size****

- 1. **Tools** menu > **Options** > **Design** tab.
- 2. In the Sheet area, locate the Size list. Leave the current sheet size and click **OK**.

****Open a previously saved file****

To make it easier to view changes in magnification, open the file named **preview.sch** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

**Tip:** If you have made any changes to the previous design, a dialog box appears prompting you to save the old file. Click **No**.

## Panning and zooming
Several methods exist for controlling the centering and magnification of a design. In this exercise, you are going to use the mouse.

For two-button mouse operations, the Zoom icon enables and disables Zoom mode. Clicking Zoom from the View menu can also enable it. While in Zoom mode, the pointer changes to a magnifying glass. For three-button mouse operations, Zoom mode is always available using the middle mouse button.

**Tip:** Because some manufacturers give the center mouse button a specific function, you may need to de-activate default mouse button functionality before you can use these features in SailWind Logic. Change mouse functionality using the Control Panel.

Zoom in and out by placing the pointer at the center of the area and dragging in a specific direction. Pan and Zoom functions are also available using commands from the View menu, using the numeric keypad, and using the scroll bars. See *SailWind Logic Help* for more information on Pan and Zoom functions.

****Practice zooming****

The following procedure assumes you are using a two-button mouse, except where noted.

1. Click the Zoom button .

**Exception:** If you are using a three-button mouse, skip this step.

2. Zoom in.

a. Click and hold the left mouse button in the center of the area you want to magnify. **Exception:** If you are using a three-button mouse, click and hold the middle mouse button.

- b. Drag the pointer upward, moving the mouse away from you. A dynamic rectangle attaches to and moves with the pointer.
- c. When the rectangle encompasses the area you want to magnify, release the mouse button to complete the operation.
- 3. Zoom out. Repeat Step 2, but drag the pointer downward, moving the mouse towards you. A static rectangle, representing the current workspace view, appears with a dynamic rectangle representing the new view of the workspace.
- 4. Practice using Zoom mode to adjust the magnification.

**Tip:** To re-establish the original view, click Sheet on the View menu.

5. Click the **Zoom** button again to end Zoom mode. **Exception**: If you are using a three-button mouse, skip this step.

****Pan****

Position the pointer in the direction you want to pan and click the middle mouse button. The new view changes to make the location of the pointer the center of the view.

## Selecting objects
When selecting parts, place the pointer on the outline of the part, and then click. Clicking inside the body of the part does not ensure selection, especially with larger parts.

****Selection Filter****

Since many types of objects make up a CAE Decal (schematic symbol) and many additional objects are found on a schematic sheet, a selection filter facilitates the selection of a single type of object.

1. Resize your view to fit an area around component U2 and U4 as shown below.

2. Right-click and click **Filter.**

**Alternative:** Press Ctrl+Alt+F to open the Selection Filter.

- 3. In the Selection Filter click **Anything**. Notice that Parts and Nets are not selected but everything else is selected.
- 4. Close the Selection Filter.
- 5. On the schematic, click the connection segment attached to U4 pin 14. The whole net is not selected, just the one connection segment.
- 6. Right-click and click **Cancel** to deselect the connection segment.
- 7. Right-click and click **Select Connections**. Click and select the same connection segment. All connection segments leading to the tie dot are selected. Right-click and click **Select Net Instance**. All connection segments of this net instance are selected. Right-click and click **Delete**. The connection is deleted.

You cannot delete individual connection segments. To delete nets or portions of nets you must select connections, net instances or an entire net and apply the delete command. **Tips:**

- You can quickly change Selection Filter settings using the filter presets. With nothing selected in the design, right-click, and click one of the Select commands.
- The Selection toolbar also contains buttons for Selection Filter settings.
- Right click and click Cancel and Delete or use the Esc (cancel) and Delete buttons on the keyboard instead.
- 8. Do not save a copy of the file.
