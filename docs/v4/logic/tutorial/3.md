# Creating Library Parts Tutorial
You create the library elements that compose a part type in the SailWind library using the Library Manager and the PCB Decal Editor.

****In this lesson:****

- Understanding the SailWind part type
- Creating a CAE decal
- Creating a new part type

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic.

## Understanding the part type
Before you can add a part to a schematic, it must exist as a part type in the library. A part type is composed of three elements:

- The schematic symbol, or CAE decal as it is called in the library.
- A component footprint, or PCB decal as it is called in the library.
- Electrical parameters, such as pin numbers and gate assignments.

| Element                | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Part type name:        | 7404                                               |
| CAE decal:             | INV (inverter)                                     |
| PCB decal:             | DIP14 (14 pin dual in line package)                |
| Electrical parameters: | Six logical gates (A through F) using 12 of the 14 |
|                        | pins with one power pin and one ground pin.        |

****An example of a part type is a 7404.****

You can create a part type in SailWind Logic or in SailWind Layout; however, you can only create a CAE decal in SailWind Logic, and a PCB decal in SailWind Layout.

****CAE decals****

Each part added to a schematic must have a CAE Decal to graphically represent the logical function of the part. While some parts are represented entirely with a single CAE decal, others are composed of multiple instances of the same CAE decal, such as part 7404, the multigated inverter mentioned above.

A CAE decal is composed of pin decals attached to terminals placed at intervals around a graphic symbol. This entity represents all or part of the device. The terminals can be assigned pin names to represent the logical function of the pin, such as IN, OUT, or VSS. All elements of a CAE decal are created in the Part Editor.

## Creating a CAE decal
In this exercise you will use the CAE Decal Wizard and other features to create a CAE decal for the 87C256 part type shown in the graphic below.

![](/logic/tutorial/3/_page_1_Figure_3.jpeg)

****Create a CAE decal****

- 1. Tools menu > Part Editor.
- 2. On the Part Editor toolbar click the **Edit Graphics** button , and then click **OK** to confirm the creation of a new CAE decal with a default name.

Once you enter the CAE Decal Editor, several text labels and a CAE decal origin marker appear.

Each of these labels are placeholders for CAE decal-related text objects. The position of these labels on the CAE decal determines where the CAE decal text object appears in the schematic. The origin marker serves as the origin for moving or positioning the CAE decal on the schematic. Select the labels and move them to where you want.

****Label Placeholder****

| REF           | The reference designator                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| PART-TYPE     | The part type (7404, 74LS74, etc.)      |
| *Free Label 1 | The first displayed part type attribute |
| *Free Label 2 | The other displayed part type attribute |

**Tip:** An attribute is a specific type of part information that can be included in the part's library description and exported to a parts list. Examples are part manufacturer, package type, and part number.

****Create CAE decals with the CAE Decal wizard****

- 1. Decal Editor Toolbar button > CAE Decal Wizard button
- 2. In the Box Parameters area, type **800** in the Min Width box.
- 3. In the Left Pins area, select **PIN** as the Pin Decal, and type **19** in the Pin Count box.
- 4. Type **0** in the Right Pins, Upper Pins, and Lower Pins Pin Count boxes.
- 5. Click **OK** to create the CAE Decal.

You now have the beginning of a CAE decal. This process creates a CAE decal with 19 terminals (the small X at the end of the pin decal) each having a PIN type pin decal.

**See also:** *SailWind Logic Help* for details on the relationship between terminals and pin decals

****Add a new terminal****

At this stage, the CAE decal is not complete. You must add output pins and modify some of the symbols on the input pins.

- 1. Add Terminal button **.**
- 2. Click the **PIN** decal from the Pins list, and click **OK**.
- 3. With the new terminal attached to the pointer, right-click and click **X Mirror**. This mirrors the terminal on the X-axis, or horizontally.
- 4. Position the terminal on the right side of the symbol, at X**1000**,Y**1900**, and click to place the terminal.

****Add new terminals with step and repeat****

After you add a terminal, SailWind Logic remains in Add terminal verb mode; the next new terminal attaches to the pointer. Instead of adding the next terminal as you did above, use the Step and Repeat feature to add several terminals quickly.

- 1. With the next new terminal attached to the pointer, right-click and click **Step and Repeat**.
- 2. Select **Down** as the Direction, type **7** in the pin Count box, and type **100** in the Distance box.
- 3. Click **OK**.
- 4. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit the Add Terminal verb mode.

****Modify terminals****

Now that you have added the output pins, use the other terminal commands to modify the input pin arrangement and complete the CAE decal. The input pins consist of 15 address inputs, 3 control inputs and one extra input pin. The pin decals for two of the control inputs need modification and you must remove the extra terminal.

- 1. Change Pin Decal button
- 2. In the Pin Decal Browse dialog box, click the **PINB** pin decal in the Pins list.
- 3. Click **OK**. You are now in a pin decal assignment mode. Any terminal that you select is assigned the PINB pin decal.
- 4. Select the two bottom input terminals on the left side of the part (terminals #**18** and #**19**) to change the pin decal on both from **PIN** to **PINB**.
- 5. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit Change Pin Decal mode.
- 6. Right-click and click **Select Terminals**. Select the fourth terminal from the bottom (terminal #**16**).
- 7. Right-click and click **Delete**. The terminal numbers following terminal #16 are renumbered to accommodate the deletion.
- 8. On the View menu, click **Extents** to fit the completed decal in the view. **Alternative:** Press Ctrl+Alt+E to view Extents.

****Assign pin numbers and pin names to a gate****

- 1. Set Pin Name button **.**
- 2. In the *Start name of a terminal* dialog box, type **Q0** and click **OK**.
- 3. Select the top-most output pin (on the right side of the component) to assign it pin name Q0.
- 4. Select the output just below pin Q0 to assign it pin name Q1.
- 5. Select the remaining output pins, in order, to assign the names Q2 through Q7.
- 6. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit the current naming mode.
- 7. Repeat steps 1 and 2, typing **A0** in the Start Name dialog box, and clicking **OK**.
- 8. Select the top-most input pin (on the left side of the component) to assign it pin name A0.
- 9. Select the input pin just below the A0 pin to assign it pin name A1.
- 10. Select the remaining input pins, in order, to assign the names A2 through A14.
- 11. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit the current mode.

Two of the remaining pins have logical NOT pin name labels (bars over the name). To create this type of text, use the \ character. Assign the remaining pin names.

- 1. Right-click and click **Select Terminals**. Select the input pin below A14.
- 2. Right-click and click **Properties**.
- 3. In the Terminal Properties dialog box, in the Name box type **\PGM\ / \CE** being careful to not use spaces in the pin name.
- 4. Click **OK**.
- 5. Click in empty space to deselect the terminal. The remaining pins will be assigned a pin name later in this tutorial.

To finish defining the decal, set pin numbers for the terminals in the same manner as assigning pin names.

- 1. On the Decal Editing Toolbar, click the **Set Pin Number** button .
- 2. In the Set Pin Numbers dialog box, accept the defaults and click OK.
- 3. Select pins, in the order shown in the 87C256 graphic at the beginning of this tutorial. Stop after you assign a pin number to pin Q2 and proceed to the next step.
- 4. Select pin Q3.

**Result:** After you select pin Q3, it is assigned pin 14. Pin 14 was previously assigned as a signal pin for GND in the electrical parameters.

- 5. To change Q3 pin number to 15, select pin **Q3** a second time; it is assigned the next highest pin number.
- 6. Select pin **Q4** to assign it as **16**.
- 7. Continue assigning pin numbers to the remaining pins.

If you assign the wrong pin number, click the Set Pin Number button again, enter the new number and click the terminal.

****Name the CAE decal and part type****

- 1. File menu > Return to Part.
- 2. Click **Yes** to keep gate changes.
- 3. On the File menu, click **Save As**.
- 4. In the Save Part and Gate Decals As dialog box, double-click in the Name of Part box, and type **87C256**.
- 5. In the Names of Gate Decals box, double-click **NEW\_PART** under the CAE Decal 1 column, and type **87C256**.
- 6. Switch the Library to **\**Libraries\preview.
- 7. Click **OK**. Confirm the overwriting of the CAE decal if it already exists.
- 8. Click **OK** to the warning of no assigned PCB Decal. Confirm the overwriting of the Part Type if it already exists.

## Creating a part type for the CAE decal
Now you will add electrical properties to the 87C256 part type and assign it a PCB decal.

****Assign a family type****

The first step in creating a part type is to assign the family type for the part.

1. Edit Electrical button > General tab.

2. In the Logic Family list, switch to **TTL** to assign it as the family type for the part type. This simply assigns a default reference designator prefix of U.

**Note:** The Pin Count displays only 26 pins.

****Assign a PCB decal****

The next step in creating a part type is to assign the 87C256 CAE decal and assign a 28-pin PCB decal.

- 1. PCB Decals tab.
- 2. In the Library list, switch to the **\Libraries\common** library.
- 3. Type **so\*** in the Filter box, type **28** in the Pin Count box, and click **Apply**.
- 4. Click the **SO28** PCB decal, and click **Assign** to assign the PCB decal as the first (and only) PCB decal for the part type. This has also increased the Pin Count for the 87C256 part type.

****Update the pin settings****

- 1. Pins tab.
- 2. Examine Gate A, the first (and only) gate of the part type.
- 3. Scroll down the list of pins to Seq. number 17 and 18. These should be pins 22 and 1.
- 4. For **Seq. 17** (pin 22), double-click in the Name box, and type **\OE**. Press **Enter**.
- 5. For **Seq. 18** (pin 1), double-click in the Name box, and type **VPP**. Press **Enter**.

**Tip:** If you want to use pin swap, terminator assignment, and topology tools in SailWind Layout, the Swap (pin swap) and Type (pin type) values for gates must be set. You can leave them as they are for this exercise.

****Assign signal pins****

Next, assign the standard power and ground pins. These are called signal pins in SailWind Logic.

- 1. Scroll down the list of pins to the bottom.
- 2. For pin **14**, in the Pin Group column, click Unused Pin and change it to Signal Pin.
- 3. Repeat for pin **28**.
- 4. Double-click in the Name box for pin 14, and type **GND**.
- 5. Double-click in the Name box for pin 28, and type **+5V**.

****Add user-defined attributes****

Finally, you will add user-defined part type attributes.

- 1. Attributes tab.
- 2. Click **Add**.
- 3. Click **Browse Lib Attr**.
- 4. In the Browse Library Attributes dialog box, click **Description** and click **OK**.
- 5. Press **Tab** to switch to the Value cell, and type **32K X 8 BIT CMOS EPROM/LATCH**.
- 6. Click **Add**, click **Browse Lib Attr** again, and repeat the previous steps to add the following attributes and values:

| Attributes      | Values        |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Cost            | (leave blank) |
| Part Number     | 87C256        |
| Manufacturer #1 | SIGNETICS     |
| Manufacturer #2 | (leave blank) |

7. When you complete the addition of all attributes, click **OK** to complete the process of assigning electrical properties and close the Part Information dialog box.

****Save the part type to the library****

- 1. On the File menu, click **Save**.
- 2. On the File menu, click **Exit Part Editor** to exit from the Part Editor and return to the Schematic Editor.

****Use the library manager****

You can edit existing part types in the library from the library manager dialog.

- 1. File menu > Library.
- 2. In the Library list, switch to the \Libraries\preview library.
- 3. Click the **Parts** button.
- 4. In the Part Types list, click **87C256**. Notice the image in the preview window. It should be the CAE Decal that is associated with the Part Type.
- 5. Click **Edit** to bring the part into the Part Editor. Close the Library Manager. You can now edit the part type, its CAE decal, and its electrical properties.
- 6. On the File menu, click **Exit Part Editor**.
- 7. Do not save a copy of the file.
