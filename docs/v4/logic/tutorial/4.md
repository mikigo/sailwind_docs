# Adding and Duplicating Parts Tutorial
Typically, schematic entry requires many add, copy, or delete part operations.

****This lesson covers the following topics:****

- Adding parts
- Deleting parts
- Duplicating parts

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic and open the file named **previewstart.sch** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

## Adding parts
As you add parts, real-time component packaging is provided to automatically assign reference designators.

****Resize your view****

Before you begin, resize your view to fit an area around U1 and the B gate of U5, as shown in the following figure.

****Add a part****

Parts are added directly from the library to the schematic. In this exercise, you will add a new AM100415 part to the schematic using the Add Part command.

1. Add Part button **.**

2. In the Add Part from Library dialog box, in the Filter area, select (All Libraries) in the Library list.

- 3. In the Items box, type **AM100\*** and click **Apply** to perform a wildcard search of the libraries for all parts containing the first five characters, AM100. Results appear in the Items list.
- 4. Select **AM100415** from the list of parts. The part appears in the preview window.
- 5. Click **Add**. The AM100415 part attaches to the pointer in the design area.
- 6. In the Add Part from Library dialog box, click **Close**.

****Place the part****

Each time you add a new part it attaches to the pointer. Complete the part addition by positioning and placing it. For this exercise you need to place the part precisely.

- 1. Position the part between R1 and U5B at **X6500**,**Y7900**. Use the coordinate display on the Status Bar as a guide. Do not use the D: (delta) coordinates.
- 2. Click to place the part on the schematic.

**Tip:** You can see that U3 is the reference designator for the part. Even though the last reference designator number used for prefix U was 7, it was determined that designator number 3 was unused. Unused numbers are automatically assigned before resuming the numbering sequence.

3. Add more parts in an empty area of the design. When you finish placing symbols, press **Esc**.

Gaps created by deleting or renumbering parts are automatically filled in to minimize part usage. When you add a multi-gated part, unused gates in existing parts are used before a new package is created.

## Deleting parts
To remove any multiple instances of AM100415:

- 1. Delete Mode button **.**
- 2. Select a duplicate of the AM100415 part. If you cannot delete the part, right-click and click **Select Parts**.

**Tip:** For best results, place the pointer on the part outline when selecting.

- 3. Repeat these steps to delete any additional parts you added, except U3.
- 4. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit Delete mode.

**Alternative:** Press Esc to cancel.

5. On the View menu, click **Redraw** to refresh the workspace display. **Alternative:** Press Ctrl+D to redraw.

## Duplicating parts
You use the Duplicate command to duplicate parts on the schematic.

1. Duplicate Mode button **.**

- 2. Select U3 to add duplicates of the AMD part. Like the Add Part command, the part attaches to the pointer and you enter Move Part mode.
- 3. Click to place several duplicates on the schematic. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit duplicating U3.

4. On the Design Toolbar, click the **Select** button to exit Duplicate Mode.

**Alternative:** Press Esc to exit the mode.

5. Right-click and click **Select Parts**. Use Ctrl+click to select all additional parts you added except U3. Right-click and click **Delete**.

**Tip:** You can apply changes to multiple objects. All parts selected in the above example, were deleted. Other options for multiple selected parts include attribute additions, attribute visibility changes, and saving to the library. The options available for multiple selections vary according to the types of objects selected.

6. Do not save a copy of the file.
