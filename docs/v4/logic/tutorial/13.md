# Managing Multiple Sheets Tutorial
SailWind Logic offers many features to manage one page schematics or schematics with hundreds of pages. Use the sheet manger to add, delete, rename or change the order of sheets in a schematic. Create custom sheet borders and title blocks, store them in the library and add them automatically to each new sheet.

To manage large nets distributed over several sheets, add off page references for each instance of a net. Use the hierarchical features of SailWind Logic to organize your schematics with hierarchical blocks.

Use the copy, paste and save to file commands to copy and reuse portions of a schematic across pages or across different schematic designs.

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic.

## Creating a custom sheet border
When you start a new design, a default sheet border is added to each new schematic sheet. You have the option to create custom borders and title blocks and set them as the default border.

****Modify the default border****

- 1. **File** menu > **New**.
- 2. **Tools** menu > **Options** > **Design** page.
- 3. Ensure the Sheet Size is set to **B** and then click **OK**.
- 4. Zoom into the title block in the lower right corner of the border.
- 5. Right-click and click **Select Documentation**.
- 6. In the Title box, click **<Title>.**
- 7. Right-click and click **Properties.**
- 8. In the Field Properties dialog box, type your company name in the **Value** box and click **OK**.

9. Click in empty space to deselect the company name.

****Save the customized border to the library****

You can save the border to the library for reuse.

- 1. Right-click > Select Drafting Items.
- 2. Select a segment of the border. **Result:** The whole border and title block are selected.
- 3. Right-click and click **Save to Library.**
- 4. In the Save Drafting Item to Library dialog box, switch the Library to the **preview** library.
- 5. In the Name of Item box, type **MYBORDER**.
- 6. Click **OK**.

****Set the default sheet border****

You can change the current default border to a custom border.

- 1. **Tools** menu > **Options** > **Design** page.
- 2. In the Sheet area, click **Choose**.
- 3. In the Get Drafting Item from Library dialog box, in the filter area, switch the Library to the **preview** library.
- 4. In the Drafting Items list, click the **MYBORDER**.
- 5. Click **OK** to close the Get Drafting Item from Library dialog box.
- 6. Click **OK** to close the Options dialog box.

## Adding a sheet
Add, delete, and modify sheets and sheet location using the Sheets dialog box.

****To add a sheet:****

- 1. **Setup** menu > **Sheets**.
- 2. Click **Add** to increase the sheets to two.
- 3. Click **Close** to exit the Sheets dialog box.

**Tip:** The Sheets dialog box contains buttons to move sheets Up and Down in the sheet order. A rename function also exists that renames sheets.

4. Note how the custom border was automatically added to the new sheet.

**Tip:** Setting a new default border affects only new sheets. It does not update the border of existing sheets. To change the sheet border on an existing sheet, delete the border and use the Add 2D Line from Library command on the Design toolbar to add a custom border.

## Off page references
A SailWind Logic schematic database contains all sheets of the schematic. This feature provides for automated insertion of page references for all nets connected with off page symbols. You add the references to schematic when the off page reference feature is enabled.

****Open a schematic****

- 1. Open the file named **preview.sch** found in \ SailWind Projects\Samples.
- 2. Zoom into the upper left portion of the schematic around the A[00-14] bus.
- 3. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
- 4. In the Off-Sheet Labels area, select the **Show Off-page Sheet Numbers** check box.
- 5. Click **OK**.

**Result:** A [1] appears under the A[00:14] bus name. This indicates that another instance of the bus is also located on page 1 of the schematic.

**Tip:** You can create a report file that lists the locations of all nets in the design. On the File menu, click Reports, and select the Off-page check box.

## Copying a portion of a schematic
You can copy and paste, or save to a file, a group of items for use on other sheets or other schematics.

**1. **Right-click** > **Select Anything**.**

2. Using area selection, create a selection box around U7 as shown below.

- 3. **Right-click** and click **Copy**.
- 4. In the Sheet list on the toolbar, select the **Power** schematic.
- 5. **Right-click** and click **Paste** and then click to place the object.
- 6. Zoom into the part and notice the nets on the left side have off-page symbols attached.
- 7. Do not save a copy of the file.

**Tip:** You use the right-click > Save to File command to save a portion of the schematic to a file and later use the Paste from File command on the Edit menu to add to a schematic.

## Hierarchical design
In hierarchical designs, basic block diagrams are used to represent interconnect between logical functions of a design. Typically, these block diagrams are shown on the first page of the schematic to aid in the navigation among various functions in the schematic. The logical blocks represent the underlying schematic for that portion of the design.

In SailWind Logic you create and add logical blocks, called hierarchical symbols, and link them directly to a subset of the SailWind Logic schematic.

****Hierarchical design example:****

To create a hierarchical schematic in SailWind Logic, you either create the hierarchical symbols first using the Decal Wizard or select a sheet and automatically define a symbol to represent its content. See SailWind Logic Help for detailed steps in creating a hierarchical design.
