# Adding Connections Tutorial

****In this lesson:****

- Adding interconnects
- Modifying connections
- Adding connections to power and ground
- Adding connections across pages

****Preparation****

If it is not already running, start SailWind Logic and open the file named **previewpart.sch** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

## Adding interconnects
To interconnect parts, use the Add Connection command. Each new connection is automatically assigned a system-generated netname.

****Add Connection command****

Once you add a part, you add the interconnects to complete the schematic. To start a new connection, you will click on the end point of the pin. A connection line attaches to the pin and follows the pointer movement.

- 1. Add Connection button **.**
- 2. Zoom into the area shown below.

- 3. Select **pin number 1** on the right side of U3.
- 4. With the end point of the new connection attached, move the pointer horizontally to the midpoint between U3 pin 1 and U5B pin 6. Click to add a new corner.
- 5. Move the pointer and notice how the end of the connection remains attached to the pointer and a 90-degree corner is dynamically added as you move in a diagonal direction.
- 6. Click to add an additional corner above U5B.
- 7. Remove the last corner you added by right-clicking and clicking **Del Corner** or by pressing **Backspace**.
- 8. Position the pointer over U3 pin 15 and click to complete the connection. Right-click and click **Cancel** to exit the Add Connection mode.

## Modifying connections
You can modify connections using either the Move or Delete commands.

****Move a connection****

Use the Move command to move the end point of the connection to another pin.

- 1. Move Mode button .
- 2. With nothing selected, right-click and click **Select Connections**.
- 3. Click at the midpoint of the connection segment attached to U3 pin 15. The connection pulls off pin 15 and the end of the connection attaches to the pointer as you enter Add Connection mode.

**Tip:** If you select U3 or a corner of the segment instead of U3 pin 15, press Esc to Cancel and try your selection again.

- 4. Move the path to U5B pin 6 and complete the connection.
- 5. Click the **Select** button on the toolbar to exit Move Mode.

****Delete a connection****

Use the Delete command to remove the connection.

- 1. Right-click and click **Select Connections**.
- 2. Select the connection between U3 pin 1 and U5B pin 6.
- 3. Right-click and click **Delete**.

****Connect U1 and U3****

Connect U3 to the other parts (in dashed lines) in the following graphic using the Add Connection, Move, and Delete commands described in the above procedures.

## Adding connections to power and ground
You can connect to power or ground with the same Add Connection operations, but you will terminate the connection using a special symbol. The symbol represents a connection to the specified net.

Create power and ground symbols in the Part Editor. Each symbol has a primary symbol and may optionally have several alternate symbols. In addition, you can associate each power or ground symbol (and its alternates) with a net and give each its own graphic symbol. This is useful when the schematic has many power or many ground nets.

****Add a power connection****

To complete the connections to U3, you must connect pin 15 of U3 to the +12V power net.

- 1. Add Connection button **.**
- 2. Select pin number **15** on U3.
- 3. Move the pointer horizontally and click to add a new corner.
- 4. With the connection attached to the pointer, right-click and click **Power**. A power symbol attaches to the pointer.

****Choose an alternate symbol****

To connect pin 15 to +12V, cycle through the alternate power symbols until you arrive at the +12V symbol.

1. With the special symbol attached to the pointer, right-click and click **Alternate**, until the netname **+12V** appears in the Status Bar.

**Alternative:** Press Ctrl+Tab.

The pin connection also appears in the Status Bar.

2. Click to complete the connection to +12V.

****Connect resistors R5 and R2 to ground and power****

There are also two resistors on the schematic requiring power and ground connections.

- 1. Use the search modeless command s (search) to locate R5. Type **sr5** and press **Enter**.
- 2. Select pin number **2** on R5. A connection attaches to the pointer.
- 3. Right-click and click **Ground**. A ground symbol attaches to the pointer.
- 4. Position the symbol just below and to the right of R5 and click to complete the connection.
- 5. Locate R2 by typing **sr2** and pressing **Enter**.
- 6. Select pin number **2** on R2. A connection attaches to the pointer.
- 7. Before you add the connection to power, you must enable the display of the netname so it is visible when the power symbol is placed on the schematic. Right-click and click **Display PG Name**.
- 8. Right-click and click **Power** to connect R2.2 to power.
- 9. With the special symbol attached to the pointer, right-click and click **Alternate**, or press **Ctrl+Tab** repeatedly until the netname **+5V** appears in the Status Bar.
- 10. Position the symbol directly above R2 and click to complete the connection.

## Adding connections across pages
Off-page symbols are added to connections to make indirect connections between net instances on the same sheet or across multiple sheets. Off-page symbols are added in the same manner as power and ground symbols.

In this section, you will add an off-page connection (in dashed lines in the graphic below).

- 1. Locate U7 by typing **su7** and pressing **Enter**.
- 2. Select pin number **1** on U7.
- 3. Move the pointer horizontally and click to add a corner in the connection. Move the pointer up and to the right just above the U7 reference designator.
- 4. Right-click and click **Offpage**.
- 5. Right-click and click **X Mirror**.
- 6. Click to place the off-page symbol, and
- 7. In the Add Net Name dialog box, type **28MHZ**, and click **OK**.
- 8. Do not save a copy of the file.
