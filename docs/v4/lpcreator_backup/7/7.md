## <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Disclaimer**

The land pattern calculators currently included with the SailWind products perform calculations based upon recommendations contained within the IPC-7351B *Generic Requirements for Surface Mount Design and Land Pattern Standard*.

The naming conventions used are also based on IPC-7351B as well as the IPC-7251 *Generic Requirements for Through-Hole Design and Land Pattern Standard* (draft). The SailWind Land Pattern Creator-generated SailWind Layout Extended Libraries were built to comply with the current versions of these standards in effect at the time the libraries were created.

Chengdu Paizi Interconnect Electronics Technology Co., Ltd. provides these libraries as a design aid to our customers to help them become familiar with the library construction process and are provided "as is" with no warranty by Paizi. It is the responsibility of the designer to verify that these parts are in compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and your company's specific design rule requirements.

If parts are found to be in error, please submit a Service Request at [market@pzeda.com](mailto:market@pzeda.com)so that the parts can be individually reviewed and potentially fixed or removed from the libraries.

#### **Table 12. Surface Mount Land Patterns(continued)**

#### **IPC-7351B Land Pattern Naming Convention Notes**

- All dimensions are in Metric Units
- All Lead Span and Height numbers go two places past the decimal point and "include" trailing Zeros
- All Lead Span and Body Sizes go two place before the decimal point and "remove" leading Zeros
- All Chip Component Body Sizes are one place to each side of the decimal point
- Pitch Values are two places to the right & left of decimal point with no leading Zeros but include trailing zeros

#### **Naming Convention Special Character Use for Land Patterns**

- The \_ (underscore) is the separator between pin Qty in Hidden & Deleted pin components
- The (dash) is used to separate the pin qty.
- The X (capital letter X) is used instead of the word "by" to separate two numbers such as height X width like "Quad Packages".

#### **IPC-7351B Suffix Naming Convention for Land Patterns**

**Common SMT Land Pattern to Describe Environment Use**

This is the last character in every name.

![](_page_4_Picture_16.jpeg)

#### **Note:**

This excludes the BGA component family as they only come in the Nominal Environment Condition

- M = Most Material Condition (Level A)
- N = Nominal Material Condition (Level B)
- L = Least Material Condition (Level C)

#### **Alternate Components that do not follow the JEDEC, EIA or IEC Standard**

- A = Alternate Component (used primarily for SOP & QFP when Component Tolerance or Height is different)
- B = Second Alternate Component

#### **Reverse Pin Order**

â€¢ -20RN = 20 pin part, Reverse Pin Order, Nominal Environment

#### **Hidden Pins**

â€¢ -20\_24N = 20 pin part in a 24 pin package. The pins are numbered 1 â€“ 24 the hidden pins are skipped. The schematic symbol displays up to 24 pins.

#### **Deleted Pins**

â€¢ -24\_20N = 20 pin part in a 24 pin package. The pins are numbered 1 â€“ 20. The schematic symbol displays 20 pins.

#### **JEDEC and EIA Standard parts that have several alternate packages**

â€¢ AA, AB, AC = JEDEC or EIA Component Identifier

#### **GENERAL SUFFIXES**

- \_HS = Land Pattern with Heat Sink attachment requiring additional holes or pads Example: TO254P1055X160\_HS-6N
- \_BEC = Base, Emitter and Collector (Pin assignments used for three pin Transistors) Example: SOT95P280X160\_BEC-3N
- \_SGD = Source, Gate and Drain (Pin assignments used for three pin Transistors) Example: SOT95P280X160\_SGD-3N
- \_213 = Alternate pin assignments used for three pin Transistors Example: SOT95P280X160\_213-3N

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Through-hole Naming Convention**

The IPC-7251 Specification provides an extensive and comprehensive method of describing through-hole land patterns through a systematic naming convention.

#### **IPC-7251 Naming Convention for Through-Hole Land Patterns**

- The land pattern naming convention uses component dimensions to derive the land pattern name.
- The first 3 6 characters in the land pattern name describe the component family.
- The first number in the land pattern name refers to the Lead Spacing or hole to hole location to insert the component lead.
- All numbers that follow the Lead Spacing are component dimensions.

These characters are used as component body identifiers that precede the value and this is the priority order of the component body identifiers â€“

- P = Pitch for components with more than two leads
- W = Maximum Lead Width (or Component Lead Diameter)
- L = Body Length for horizontal mounting
- D = Body Diameter for round component body
- T = Body Thickness for rectangular component body
- H = Height for vertically mounted components
- Q = Pin Quantity for components with more than two leads
- R = Number of Rows for connectors
- A, B & C = the fabrication complexity level as defined in the IPC-2221 and IPC-2222

#### **Notes:**

- All component body values are in millimeters and go two places to the right of the decimal point and no leading zeros.
- All Complexity Levels used in the examples are "B".

## <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Padstack Naming Convention**

The padstack consists of combinations of letters and numbers that represent shape, or dimensions of lands on different layers of printed boards or documentation. The name of the padstack needs to represent all the various combinations. These are used in combination with the land pattern conventions defined herein according to the rules established in the IPC-2220 Design standards.

The first part of the padstack convention consists of a land (pad) shape. There are six basic land shape identifiers

![](_page_19_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Note:** All alphabetical characters are "lower case". This helps discriminate numeric values.

#### **Basic Land Shape Letters**

- **c** = Circular
- **s** = Square
- **r** = Rectangle

**b** = Oblong

**u** = User Defined (Irregular Shape)

**d** = D Shape (Square on one end and Circular on the other end)

![](_page_20_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Note:**

The "b" was used for Oblong because the letter "o" can easily be confused with the character zero "0".

#### **Padstack Defaults**

The following are assumed defaults to keep the default padstack name short and simple. Any deviations from these padstack defaults require the use of special modifiers.

- Solder Mask is 1:1 scale of the land size (\*see Solder Mask Scale note below)
- Paste Mask is 1:1 scale of the land size
- The Assembly Layer land is 1:1 scale of the land size
- Inner Layer Land is the same shape as the outer layer land
- The Primary and Secondary lands are the same size
- The inner layer land shapes are Circular
- Vias are Circular
- Thermal ID, OD and Spoke Width sizes follow the IPC Level A, B or C
- Plane Clearance Anti-pad size follows the IPC Level A, B or C
- Thermals have 4 spokes
- Mounting Holes are Circular

#### **Restriction:**

Illegal characters that cannot be used (Microsoft requirement) include " ", ; : / \ [ ] ( ) . { } \* & % # \$ ! @ ^ =

#### **Solder Mask Scale**

Every board fabricator's ability to register solder mask is different. The 1:1 scale solder mask default compensates for the variation, and so long as manufacturers are building to standard specifications such as the IPC-6012 that states you can't have misregistration of the solder mask. It's important that when you are creating a CAD library that will be used for various trace/space combinations, that you leave the responsibility of the solder mask swell up to the fabrication CAM operator when they are panelizing your

Gerber or ODB++ data. By having all of the solder mask sizes 1:1 scale of the land (pad) size, you are providing the manufacturer with a known starting point for them to work with.

**Exception:** Creating solder mask defined lands for BGAs. IPC does not recommend solder mask defined BGA CAD library parts but some companies use this technique for very fine pitch parts that require a small diameter land size. In this case, the solder mask acts as an adhesive to secure the land to the PCB Prepreg to withstand drop testing for hand held electronic products. It has been proven in drop tests for hand held electronic devices that a fine pitch BGA solder joint is more secure than the land attachment to the Prepreg. i.e.: during drop testing, a fine pitch BGA pad will rip away from the PCB Prepreg material before the BGA solder joint fails. See Figure 1 as an example of a solder mask defined BGA land.

![](_page_21_Figure_3.jpeg)

![](_page_21_Figure_4.jpeg)

Solder mask defined lands are also used for Flexible circuit boards for the same reason, to hold the land (pad) to the PCB surface to prevent the land from ripping away from the PCB material. When you use solder mask defined lands you must indicate which parts deviate from the 1:1 scale solder mask rule in the fabrication drawing notes to notify the CAM operator not to swell these solder mask features.

#### **PAD Stack Constructions**

The following sample padstack names are based on the IPC-7251/7351 Padstack Naming Convention. Examples utilizing the padstack naming convention (all values are in metric units)

**Note:** Every number goes two places to the right and as many as needed to the left of the decimal. Examples: 1150 = 11.50 mm or 11500 Âµm, 150 = 1.50 mm or 1500 Âµm, 15 = 0.15 mm or 150 Âµm

- **c150h90**â€”where "c" denotes a Circular land with a 1.50 diameter and H denotes a hole size of 0.90
- **v50h25**â€”where a "v" denotes a via with a 0.50 land (default Circular land) and H denotes a 0.25 hole
- **s150h90**â€”where "s" denotes a 1.50 Square land and H denotes a hole size of 0.90
- **s350**â€”where "s" denotes a square SMT land size of 3.50
- **r200\_100**â€”where "r" denotes a Rectangular SMT land 2.00 land length X 1.00 land width
- **b300\_150**â€”where "b" denotes a SMT Oblong land size of 3.00 X 1.50
- **b400\_200h100**â€”where "b" denotes an Oblong land size of 4.00 length X 2.00 width and 1.00 hole
- **d300\_150**â€”where "d" denotes land with one circular end and one square end (looks like a D) 3.00 X 1.50
- **v30h15l1-3**â€”where "v" denotes a 0.30 blind via with 0.15 Hole; 1 is the starting layer, 3 is the end layer
- **r200\_100r5**â€”Rounded Rectangular 2mm X 1mm X 0.05mm radius corners
- **r200\_100c10**â€”Chamfered Rectangular 2mm X 1mm X 0.1mm chamfered corners
- **v30h15l3-6**â€”where "v" denotes a 0.30 buried via with 0.15 Hole; 3 is the starting layer, 6 is the end layer

The through hole "IPC-7251 Padstacks.xls" file should be used as the basis for a new chart in IPC-7251 and IPC-7351B.

![](_page_22_Picture_10.jpeg)

#### **Note:**

Supporting paragraphs containing formulae, document the math involved. It is assumed that the padstack has the same value as the mounted layer size and shape for Ã±

- Inner Layer
- Opposite Side
- Solder Mask
- Solder Paste
- Assembly Layers

It is also assumed that the "Plane Clearance" and "Thermal Relief" data follows the through-hole convention guidelines defined in the IPC-2221 and IPC-2222 standards.

#### **Modifiers that are used when padstack features are different than the defaults**

These are the "Variants" or "Modifiers" that go after the basic padstack naming convention. These are used when you need to change the padstack default values either by a different dimension or a different shape. In instances where shapes are different this becomes a two letter code with the modifier first followed by the land shape letter.

- **n** = Non-plated Hole
- **z** = Inner Layer land dimension if different than the land on primary layer
- **x** = Special modifier used alone or following other modifiers for lands on opposite side to primary layer land dimension
- **t** = Thermal Relief; if different than IPC standard padstack tid\_od\_sw for 4 spoke default
- **m** = Solder Mask if different than default 1:1 scale of land
- **p** = Solder Paste if different than default 1:1 scale of land
- **a** = Assembly surface land if different than default 1:1 scale of land
- **y** = Plane Clearance (Anti-pad) if the value is different than the Thermal OD
- **o** = Offset Land Origin
- **k** = Keep-out
- **r** = Radius for Rounded Rectangular Land Shape
- **c** = Chamfer for Chamfered Rectangular Land Shape

Shape change is the last letter in the string prior to the dimension.

#### **Other usage of the padstack naming convention**

**USE of letter v**: Vias can be named using the pad stack naming convention. Because most vias use lands that are circular in shape, the letter V will be used in place of the letter C in the padstack naming convention. If this is not true the modifiers can be added after the letter V to signify shape or dimensional changes to this default.

**USE of letter w**: In addition to Vias the padstack naming convention can also be used for defining mounting holes. The letter W shall be used to define the mounting hole characteristics and any associated lands used for the surface lands (either plated or un-plated)

#### **Examples of double character modifiers**

- **ts** = Thermal Square; if different than the top side land shape and dimensions
- **sw** = Thermal spoke width
- **zs** = Inner Layer Land Shape is Square (**Note:** The default is circular)
- **m0** = No Solder Mask
- **mxc** = Solder Mask Opposite Side Circular
- **mx0** = Solder Mask Opposite Side No Solder Mask
- **xc** = Opposite Side Circular

**vs** = Via with Square land

**hn** = Non-plated Hole

#### **Modifier Example for Through-hole**

**s150h90zs150** = where "s" is Square 1.50 land with 0.90 Hole with 1.50 inner (Z) Layer Square land

**c150h90zc150** = where "c" is Circular 1.50 land with 0.90 Hole with 1.50 inner (Z) Layer Circular land

**Modifier Examples for Vias**

**vs50h25** = where "vs" denotes a 0.50 Square Via with a 0.25 Hole

**v50h25xs70** = where "v" is 0.50 Circular Via with 0.25 Hole and 0.70 Square land on opposite side

## **Modifiers for Chamfered and Rounded Corners**

Chamfered & Rounded corner modifiers are used to indicate which corner(s) are modified. Order of precedence has been given to the first 4 modifiers.

## <span id="page-29-0"></span>**Land Pattern Name Syntax**

Land Pattern Names are generally derived by combining the name of the component category with a dimensional aspect of the component and the number of pins followed by a suffix derived from the environmental application.

If additional characteristics are required they should be added as an alphabetical character, or combinations of characters that preceded the suffix.

For a complete description of the naming process, you should get the "IPC-7351 Land Pattern Naming Convention.pdf" file first.

**Sample Name:** QFP65P + Lead Span L1 X Lead Span L2 Nominal - Pin Qty

The + (plus sign) stands for "in addition to" (no space between the prefix and the body size)

The - (dash) is used to separate the pin qty.

The X (capital letter X) is used instead of the word "by" to separate two numbers such as height X width like "Quad Packages".

#### **SUFFIXES**

#### **Environmental Application.**

Suffixes for every common SMT land pattern describe the environment application (This is the last character in every name)

**Note:** This excludes the BGA.

Three land pattern geometry variations are supplied for each of the device families; maximum land protrusion (Density Level A), median land protrusion (Density Level B) and minimum land protrusion (Density Level C). Before adapting the minimum land pattern variations you should consider product qualification testing based on the conditions shown in Table 3-13.

- **M Density Level A: Maximum (Most) Land Protrusion**â€”For low-density product applications, the 'maximum' land pattern condition has been developed to accommodate wave or flow solder of leadless chip devices and leaded gull- wing devices. The geometry furnished for these devices, as well as inward and "J"-formed lead contact device families, may provide a wider process window for reflow solder processes as well.
- **N Density Level B: Median (Nominal) Land Protrusion**â€”Products with a moderate level of component density may consider adapting the 'median' land pattern geometry. The median land patterns furnished for all device families will provide a robust solder attachment condition for reflow solder processes and should provide a condition suitable for wave or reflow soldering of leadless chip and leaded gull-wing type devices.
- **L Density Level C: Minimum (Least) Land Protrusion**â€”High component density typical of portable and hand-held product applications may consider the 'minimum' land pattern geometry variation. Selection of the minimum land pattern geometry may not be suitable for all product use categories. The use of classes of performance (1, 2, and 3) is combined with that of component density levels (A, B, and C) in explaining the condition of an electronic assembly. As an example, combining the description as Levels 1A or 3B or 2C, would indicate the different combinations of performance and component density to aid in understanding the environment and the manufacturing requirements of a particular assembly.

#### **Alternate Components that do not follow JEDEC, EIA or IEC standard.**

- A Alternate Component (used primarily for SOP & QFP when Component Tolerance or Height is different) AA, AB, etc. - JEDEC or EIA Component Identifier (Used primarily on Chip Resistors, Inductors and Capacitors).
- B Second Alternate Component

#### **Reverse Pin Order.**

â€¢ -20RN - 20 pin part, reverse pin order, Nominal environment.

#### **Hidden Pins.**

â€¢ -20\_24N - 24 pin locations with 20 pins populated. Pin numbering follows pin locations (pins number 1 to 24).

#### **Deleted Pins.**

â€¢ -24\_20N - 24 pin locations with 20 pins populated. Pin numbering follows populated pins (pin number 1 to 20).

#### **General Suffixes**

**HS**â€”Land Pattern with Heat Sink attachment requiring additional holes or pads. Example:TO254P1055\_HS-6N

**BEC**â€”Base, Emitter and Collector (Pin assignments used for three pin Transistors)

**SGD**â€”Source, Gate and Drain (Pin assignments used for three pin Transistors)

<span id="page-31-0"></span>**213**â€”Alternate pin assignments used for three pin Transistors

## **Component Zero Rotations**

Each land pattern described in the IPC-7351B and IPC-7251 Specification contains recommendations for zero rotation of the base land patterns. This helps to provide a baseline to assembly operations so that pick and place machines can properly orient their feeders and deliver components to the machine in a predictable orientation.

## **Pin # 1 Orientations**

Pin 1 locations (top view) are typically oriented to the top left of the land pattern.

# **Figure 21. IPC-7351 Zero Orientation with Pin 1 Upper Left**
