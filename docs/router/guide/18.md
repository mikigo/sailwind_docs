# Chapter 18 Selective Autorouting
Instead of batch autorouting named design objects, you can autoroute components and nets by selecting them in the design. The autorouter then routes them immediately.

You can select objects whose nets you want to autoroute, and instead of using the Strategy dialog box, you can use a command to run a pass type on the selection. These autorouting commands are available on the Routing toolbar and on the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click the selected object.

The pass type SailWind Router uses when running pass types on your selections is similar to the pass type set in the Strategy dialog box for batch autorouting. However, you cannot change the settings for this pass type, and the pass types are limited to the following:

- **Route**  This lets you preroute objects in specific routing modes, such as routing a BGA in any-angle mode, and then protecting the routes before batch autorouting the design in diagonal mode. Follows options set in the **Routing** tab of the Options dialog box.
- **Fanout**  Fans out selected components before routing the rest of the board. Follows options set in the **Fanout** tab of the Options dialog box.
- **Optimize**  Uses the highest possible intensity, to let you interactively improve critical areas of the design after batch autorouting.
- **Tune** Adjusts the length of selected traces (including differential pairs) or traces attached to selected components to meet length rules.
- **Center**  Places traces equidistant from the pads of adjacent component pins or vias to evenly distribute any available space in the channel.

## Autorouting by Selection
You can start autorouting after you set options and preferences defining how you want to route your design.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the standard toolbar, click the **Routing** button or click the **View > Toolbars > Routing Toolbar** menu item.
- 2. Select the object to route.
- 3. Click the **Route** button.

**Tip**

SailWind Router routes the net or the net attached to the selected object by using the settings in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **Strategy** subcategory. You cannot route only a pin pair or link in this program; you must route the entire net.

| Note: |

When you start autorouting or running pass types on selection, the program performs a prerouting analysis and reports any errors or warnings to the **Status** tab of the Output window. If you want to correct any of the reported issues, you must first stop autorouting.

## Running Pass Types in Object Mode
You can run a pass type on a selection, independently of any strategy settings in the Options dialog box, while operating in Object mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the component, pin, net, unroute, or trace on which you want to perform the pass type. The pass type is run on the selected net or the net connected to the selected component or pin.
- 2. Right-click and click one of the available pass types.

| Object    | Pass Type                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Component | Route, Fanout, Optimize, Tune |
| Pin       | Route, Fanout, Optimize       |
| Net       | Route, Optimize, Tune, Center |
| Unroute   | Route                         |
| Trace     | Center                        |

**Table 77. Available Pass Types for Object Types**

**Tip**

When you run pass types, the program performs a prerouting analysis and reports any errors or warnings to the **Status** tab of the Output window.

## Running Pass Types in Verb Mode
You can run a pass type on a selection, independent of any strategy settings in the Options dialog box, while operating in Verb mode.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Routing toolbar, click the pass type button you want to use: Routeon page 271, Fanouton page 266, Optimizeon page 269, Tune on page 272, or Centeron page 265.
- 2. Select the component, pin, net, unroute, or trace on which you want to perform the pass type. The selection filter automatically updates, allowing you to select only an object to which the command applies.
- 3. Click the pass type button again or press the Esc key to exit Verb mode.

Setting Up the Autorouting Strategy

## Centering Traces
Center is a pass of the autorouter that you can run on selected traces. The center pass places the traces equidistant from the pads of adjacent component pins or vias to evenly distribute any available space in the channel. Centering does not violate design rules.

The following figure illustrates trace centering.

![](/router/guide/18/_page_2_Figure_15.jpeg)

To limit the number of channels to center, set a maximum channel width. Any channel larger than this width is not eligible for centering. Set the Maximum channel width in the Options dialog box > **Routing**  category > **General** subcategory.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Center** popup menu item.

## Assigning Test Points After Autorouting
This process adds test points (using the test point pass) to an already routed board. This process sacrifices accessibility for higher completion rates.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then in the Options dialog box, click the Test Points on page 459 category.
- 2. In the "Create test points" area, clear the "Create test points during autorouting" check box. Set other testability options as needed.
- 3. Click the **Routing** category > **Strategy** subcategory.
- 4. In the table of the "Pass definition" area, select the Pass check box for the Test Point pass type.
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. Click the **Tools > Autoroute > Start** menu item.

You can use the Test Point pass with other pass types. Routing completes for the entire design and then SailWind Router adds test points.

**Note:**

Test point keepouts set in SailWind Layout are respected during test point placement.
