# **Chapter 3 Preparing a Design**

Your design must meet certain requirements before you import it into SailWind Router. After carefully preparing your design for import and ensuring it meets all the prerequisites, you can import it using a synchronization process for switching back and forth between SailWind Layout and SailWind Router.

# <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Advanced Features in SailWind Router**

SailWind Router provides advanced features that enable you to perform routing, placement, and design rule checking at a level of detail beyond that of SailWind Layout.

![](_page_0_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** Alternatively, you can watch videos of the advanced features in SailWind Router for placing and routing your design. See SailWind Router Introductory Videos for Netlist Projects.

SailWind Router includes the following advanced features.

- **Unique component placement grid**  Having components on a separate grid allows you to use another grid with a different resolution simultaneously for routing the design.
- **Visual design rule checking while placing components** Visual indicators, such as markers for clearance violations, appear while placing components. A description of each error appears simultaneously in the Spreadsheet window, providing quick viewing during placement.
- **Advanced design rule checking**  While performing design rule checks, you can specify which design items to check and what action you want SailWind Router to take for any violations or errors it encounters (such as ignore them). With design rule checking enabled, you can also pause when errors appear during actions such as routing or component placement. You can examine such errors in detail in the Spreadsheet window, allowing you to modify your design when necessary.
- **Advanced routing capabilities**  SailWind Router provides additional routing tools not available in SailWind Layout. For example, you can implement design rules for specialty design features such as differential pairs, accordions, and fanouts. Other capabilities include the following:
	- Tuning
	- Pad centering
	- Visual design rule checking indicators while routing
- Automatic test point additions
- Net scheduling
- Trace plowing
- **Customization of Keepout fill**  Typically, keepouts created in SailWind Layout appear hatched in SailWind Router. If desired, you can change the fill pattern of your keepouts using the extended keepout fill options in SailWind Router to distinguish them from copper, fills, and other plane areas. You can access fill pattern settings for both keepouts and copper, fills, and planes in the Options dialog box > **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- **Dynamic copper healing**  Flooded copper in copper planes adjusts automatically to changes made within the shape. You do not need to flood the shape to see updates to clearances in the fill. For example, if you move a component, the copper floods to the required clearances around its new position immediately. You can enable the dynamic copper healing feature in the Options dialog box > **Flooding** category.
- **Navigation window**  This window provides an alternate view of the workspace while navigating your design:
	- Displays a magnified view of the design when nothing is selected
	- Displays cross sectional details when a pin or via is selected
	- Magnifies the view of any component selected in the design
	- Magnifies the view of any net objected selected in the design
	- Monitors and displays the routed length of any length-controlled net during interactive routing

The Navigation window features command buttons that let you show, hide, or zoom in and out from various design features (such as traces or components) from the view in the Navigation window.

- **Spreadsheet window**  This window lets you view and modify design object properties or cross probe design rule checking violations flagged in the design. For example, design rule violation details appear in the **Error** tab of the window. You can thus view design error details as they occur while routing or placing components, allowing you to make design modifications as necessary.
- **Autorouting capability**  You can choose to perform batch autorouting and you can also select individual nets, components, or pin pairs for selective autorouting.

◦ For batch autorouting, determine your strategy first. For example, route or plan to route denser components (such as BGAs) before routing other components.

### **Tip**

Even if you are planning to manually route your design, you can use the autorouter to make a "first pass" at the design to determine the tightest channels and most problematic areas.

◦ For selective autorouting, select a component or net, then right-click and choose one of the manual routing options (Route, Fanout, Optimize, Tune, or Center). For best results, protect the routes when finished to ensure they remain unchanged during any subsequent batch autorouting.

# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Prerequisites for Opening a Design in SailWind Router**

You must complete a number of prerequisite tasks prior to bringing a design into the SailWind Router workspace. Your particular design may or may not require some tasks.

### **Requirements**

You must complete these tasks in SailWind Layout prior to opening the design in SailWind Router:

- Create the board outline
- Define the layer structure of the board including the number of layers and their functional assignments (as a minimum you need to define component mounting layer(s), routing layer(s), and if they are required - power/ground planes)
- Define any keepouts:
	- Placement (including component height restrictions)
	- Component drill
	- Trace and copper
	- Copper planes
	- Via and jumper

SailWind Router Guide 31

- Test points
- Accordions
- Import the design netlist from your schematic tool
- Define the padstacks for all of the vias that you will be using to route the board (standard, micro/ laser, blind, and/or buried)
- Define any coppers/copper cutouts, copper planes/copper plane cutouts, hatch areas (Note: Router sees hatch outline differently than pour outlines)
- Disperse the components
- Define any Reuse elements required by the design (functionality not available in SailWind Router)
- Create any component unions that may be required
- Check to be sure you have assigned the geometry.height attribute to components if you will be using any component height keepout restrictions

#### **Recommendations**

Though it is not a prerequisite to perform the following tasks before opening a design in SailWind Router, if you eventually need any of these design features, keep in mind that you can only complete them in SailWind Layout:

- Create any cutouts or slots in the board outline
- Define additional items in the layer structure of the board such as silkscreen, paste mask, solder mask, drill, assembly, or any other specific-use layers
- Add any non-ECO registered components such as tooling holes, mounting holes, fiducials, heat sinks, and hardware (optional, if used)
- Create any 2D line items required such as title block, board markings (text on board), graphic elements, solder mask reliefs (copper on SM layer), company logos, and other items that your company standards require

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Synchronization Mode**

Synchronization mode links SailWind Layout and SailWind Router. As you work in SailWind Router, changes you make also appear in SailWind Layout; as you work in SailWind Layout, the changes appear in SailWind Router. When you are in Synchronization mode, you can instantly switch between the two programs, but you are restricted in what you can do in the inactive program.

If you perform an unsupported command or change an unsupported option, the inactive program becomes unsynchronized.

#### **Note:**

You must and then restart SailWind Layout before Synchronization mode takes effect.

Despite synchronizing with SailWind Router, you must actively switch back to SailWind Layout in order to work on your design in SailWind Layout.

You can still use automation; however, most Automation methods will not return any valuable results and will not make any changes in the database.

## <span id="page-4-1"></span>**Enabling Synchronization Mode**

Synchronization mode links SailWind Layout and SailWind Router so that the design appears in both programs simultaneously, enabling you to work in either tool without closing the design in one program first.

![](_page_4_Picture_12.jpeg)

#### **CAUTION:**

Synchronization mode can only be set from SailWind Layout and must be initiated prior to trying to send a design to SailWind Router.

### **Procedure**

- 1. In SailWind Layout, click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category, **Synchronization** subcategory.
- 3. In the Layout and Router Synchronization area, select the Enable check box.

Switching to SailWind Router automatically places the design inside SailWind Layout in DRC Off mode (the DRC mode in SailWind Router is not affected); therefore, you may want to select the "Restore DRC Mode on return" check box. This setting restores the DRC mode that existed before switching to SailWind Router when you switch back to SailWind Layout. Depending on the size of your design, restoring the DRC mode may take a few minutes.

- 4. To receive a warning that your design is being placed into DRC Off mode when you switch to Synchronization mode, click "Warn about switching to DRC Off mode" (this check box is not available if you select the "Restore DRC mode on return" check box in step 3).
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. Restart SailWind Layout.

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Sending a Design to SailWind Router in Synchronization Mode**

Use Synchronization mode to transfer your design to SailWind Router while keeping the design open in SailWind Layout.

**Procedure**

- 1. Enable Synchronization mode as described in ["Enabling Synchronization Mode"on page 33.](#page-4-1)
- 2. Switch to SailWind Router using one of the following:
	- On the Standard Toolbar, click the **Route** button.
	- Click the **Tools > SailWind Router** menu item, and in the SailWind Router Link dialog box, select an Action and click **Proceed**.

#### **Results**

**Tip** To switch back to SailWind Router, click the **Route** button on the main toolbar in SailWind Layout.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Unsupported Actions in Synchronization Mode**

Synchronization mode does not support some commands and options. If you perform one of these commands, or change one of the options, SailWind Layout and SailWind Router become unsynchronized.

#### **Unsupported commands**

- Changing a drafting object: copper, copper planes, text, 2D lines, keepouts, labels, board outlines, and dimensioning. However, you can move a component that has drafting objects attached to it without causing the programs to become unsynchronized.
- Changing rules
- Changing padstacks or layer definitions
- Importing ASCII files (or any other import)
- Verifying the design
- Changing reuses and clusters
- ECO or BGA operations
- Updating from the library
- Using the Decal Editor
- Inserting an OLE object
- Any operation that clears the Undo buffer including Autorouting and large group moves

#### **Unsupported option changes**

- Design For Fabrication (DFF)
- Design for Test (DFT)
- Verify Design
- Drafting
- Split/Mixed Plane
- Thermals
- ECO Options
- Via Patterns

[Resynchronizing When the Design Becomes Unsynchronized](#page-7-0)

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Resynchronizing When the Design Becomes Unsynchronized**

If you perform an unsupported command or change an unsupported option, the inactive program becomes unsynchronized. The status bar displays the synchronization status - Active, Inactive, or Out of sync. You must resynchronize the design in SailWind Layout or SailWind Router.

#### **Procedure**

To re-synchronize the two programs:

- If SailWind Router is "Active" and SailWind Layout is "Out of sync", on the main toolbar in SailWind Router, click the **Layout** button.
- If SailWind Layout is "Active" and SailWind Router is "Out of sync", on the main toolbar in SailWind Layout, click the **Route** button.

#### **Note:**

To turn off the display of licensing warnings when switching between SailWind Layout and SailWind Router, type the following text into the *SailWindRouter.ini* file (you do not need to restart SailWind Router afterward):

```
[Security]
DisplayWarnings=0
```
### **Results**

The previously out of sync program is updated with the latest design changes and becomes the active program.

### **Related Topics**

[Unsupported Actions in Synchronization Mode](#page-6-0)

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>**Exiting Synchronization Mode**

You can exit Synchronization mode at any time after making design changes.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Determine which application you would like to continue working in.
- 2. To exit Synchronization mode, close the other application.

In Synchronization mode, the **Layout** button (on the SailWind Router Standard Toolbar) does not send your design to SailWind Layout and then close SailWind Router; therefore, you must close the application manually. However, if one of the programs is out of sync, make sure you save your changes if you want to keep them. For example, if you want to continue working in SailWind Router, but no longer want to be in Synchronization mode, close SailWind Layout. When prompted, save your design.
