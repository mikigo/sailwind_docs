# Chapter 15 Copper Planes and Copper Shapes
SailWind Router provides tools for creating and customizing the shape of copper planes and copper shapes, including merging and subtracting shapes, creating arcs, and adding or deleting voids.

Any copper planes and shapes that you create or modify in SailWind Router transfer with the design when you open it in SailWind Layout.

## Migration to Copper Planes
Prior to the VX.2.4 release, PADS Layout used copper pours on "No Plane" layers and plane areas on "Split/mixed" layers. For all later releases, the software unifies copper pours and plane areas into "copper planes." If you open a design saved in an earlier version, the software migrates or converts all copper pours and plane areas to copper planes and applies design rules accordingly. Certain clearance and connectivity changes in your design may result.

The following changes take place during the migration to copper planes:

• The "Replace unused pads with antipads" setting, found in the "Flooding Options"on page 447, is extended to "No Plane" layers. With this setting enabled, all pads are removed on all internal "No Plane" and "Split/Mixed" layers unless the pin is connected to a trace or a copper plane on that layer. Prior to the PADS VX.2.4 release, unused pads were removed only from "Split/Mixed" layers.

- Copper pours converted to copper planes are affected by the "Connect to copper plane with thermal" check box (in the Pin, or Via Properties dialog boxes). Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the setting applied only to plane areas on Split/Mixed layers. This means, for example, if you have disabled thermal connections for a pad or via by clearing the "Connect to copper plane with thermal" check box, the software removes the thermal connection to copper planes (old copper pours) on "No Plane" layers when you import the design into a newer release.
- You can apply custom thermals and custom antipads to copper planes on "No Plane" layers in addition to "Split/Mixed" layers. Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the custom thermals and antipads applied only to plane areas on "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Prior to PADS VX.2.4, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a plane area on a "Split/Mixed" layer even though a trace was connected to it. With later releases, any component pin with an attached trace does not receive a thermal connection if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting is disabled in the "Flooding Options"on page 447. This was already the case for copper pours beginning with the PADS VX.2.3 release, and has been extended to copper planes on "Split/Mixed" layers in subsequent releases. Prior to PADS VX.2.3, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a copper pour even though a trace was connected and the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting was disabled if an additional unrouted pin pair connection existed on the pin. Via pads will still receive thermal connections to copper planes regardless of the setting.
- One smoothing radius setting in the "Flooding Options"on page 447 applies to all copper planes, regardless of the layer on which they reside. Previous releases had separate smoothing radius settings for copper pours and plane areas. The copper pours value from the flooding of an existing design is retained in VX.2.4 and later releases. It may be necessary to adjust the smoothing radius value if you experience connectivity errors in VX.2.4 that were not present in the prior version.
- The setting "Remove violating thermal spokes" is removed in SailWind Layout. All violating thermals spokes are removed by default. This is a hard-coded setting that cannot be modified.
- The modeless command "PO" toggles copper planes between pour outline and the flooded hatch display.
- When flooding drafting shapes, the copper floods to the inner edge of completed cut out outlines (not the centerline).

**Figure 39. Cut Out Pour Boundary**

![](/router/guide/15/_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

• Beginning with PADS VX.2.6, the origin of the copper plane hatch grid is calculated from the lower left corner (if one exists or calculated if one does not exist) of the pre-flooded shape. If you used a hatched fill instead of a solid fill in a pre-VX.2.6 design, the hatch grid might not have the same origin and placement of the lines of the hatch grid. As a result, pins or vias that touched and connected to the hatch grid might not be connected. Other pins that did not touch or connect to the hatch grid might be in a position to connect.

The origin of the hatch grid pattern is defined by an imaginary box surrounding the extents of the copper plane shape. The extents box is reduced by ½ the line width of the copper plane shape and the hatch grid origin is placed in the lower left corner of the extents box. For a simple rectangular copper plane shape the hatch grid origin will be in the lower left corner of the shape. For more complex shapes, the lower left corner of the extents may be a point outside of the copper plane shape. This is not the origin of the copper plane shape, only the origin of the hatch pattern for the copper plane.

## Set Drafting Options Before Creating a Drafting Object
You can set various drafting options before you begin using the Drafting Operations Toolbar to add copper shapes, copper planes, cut outs, and voids.

**Set Line Width**

You can use one of the following methods to set the width of the lines in the drafting object you are creating:

- Type W<nn>, where <nn> is the width value.
- Click either the **Copper**, **Copper Plane**, or the **Copper Plane Cutout** button:

Right-click and choose the **Width > Set** popup menu item to type a new value.

• Set the default width value in the "Text and Lines options" on page 462. (When you set the default line width in the Options dialog box, you can also enable the software to prompt you for a net to associate with any copper shape or copper plane you create.)

**Set Layer Placement**

Choose one of the following methods to select the layer for the placement of your drafting object:

- Before clicking any of the drafting buttons, type L<n>, where <n> is a layer number.
- Click either the **Copper**, **Copper Plane**, or the **Copper Plane Cutout** button:

Specify the layer using the Layer dropdown list on the Standard Toolbar.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_5_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Note:**

You can change the layer of a drafting object after creating it by selecting the object and choosing a new layer from its Properties dialog box or by choosing a layer from the Layer dropdown list. All active segments of the drawing change to the new layer selection.

**Set Corner Angle**

Set the corner angle after clicking either the **Copper**, **Keepout**, **Copper Plane**, or the **Copper Plane Cut Out** button.

Before you begin drafting, right-click and choose either the **Orthogonal**, **Diagonal**, or **Any Angle** popup menu item. If desired, you can right-click and switch angle settings at any time while drafting a shape. This capability allows you to change drafting angles multiple times for a single shape.

## Edge Precision of Drafting Shapes
You often need to precisely control the edge of drafting shapes, as many factors contribute to that edge.

**Line Width**

The precision of edges is controlled by the line width used to create the shape. The default line width is set in the **Text and Lines** category of the Options dialog box. However, you can change the line width prior to, or after creating your shape. Use a very narrow outline width to achieve a sharp corner or increase the value for more blunt corners. All corners are rounded with a radius equal to one half of the outline width.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_5_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Note:**

In some cases, setting the line width too wide results in creation of a self-intersecting polygon. For more information, see ["Self-Intersecting Polygons"on page 237.](#page-18-0)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Design and Hatch Grids**

Lines are used to create the outline of the shape and are also used to create the fill inside electrical drafting items. Lines or outlines are placed on the design grid. Then shapes are filled using horizontal lines placed on the Hatch Grid.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_6_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Clearance Rules**

If you are creating a copper plane and your drafting shape is near another object, the resulting poured outline could be displaced by the clearance rules of that object.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 44. Clearance Rule Effect on the Hatch Outline**

## Creating a Copper Shape
Copper is used to create heat sinks, shielding, and net bridges. You can assign nets to copper shapes.

**Prerequisites**

• Ensure you select a layer for placement of the copper. You cannot create a copper shape on all layers (layer number zero). If you need the same copper shape on many layers, copy the shape to other layers in SailWind Layout (SailWind Router does not provide copying capabilities).

**Video**

The following video demonstrates fundamental steps for creating and editing copper shapes.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_7_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Procedure**

- 1. On the Drafting Operations toolbar, click the **Copper**button.
- 2. Right-click and click a command to change the values of the drafting object as necessary.
- 3. Create the shape using one of the following:
- [Creating a Circle Drafting Object](#page-13-0)
- [Creating a Polygon Drafting Object](#page-12-0)
- [Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object](#page-13-1)
- 4. After completing the shape, if you have selected the "Prompt for net name at completion of copper" check box in the Options dialog box (**Text and Lines** category), the "Copper Properties dialog box" on page 471 displays. Make changes to the copper properties.

For example, you can assign a net by selecting the net name from the Net list. You can also specify the line width, the layer on which the copper is located, and whether or not the copper shape is solid (filled).

![](/router/guide/15/_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

Select the "Solid" check box in the Copper Properties dialog box to enable or disable solid fill of the shape. If you clear the check box, whenever you enable copper or copper plane hatching to display, the copper drafting object fills according to the settings in the **Global**  category > **General** subcategory of the "Options dialog box"on page 441.

- 5. Click **OK** to close the Copper Properties dialog box.
- 6. Verify the resulting shape displays as expected.
	- If the shape edges are not correct, see ["Edge Precision of Drafting Shapes"on page 224](#page-5-0).
	- If the shape needs to be modified, see ["Drafting Object Properties"on page 244.](#page-25-0)
	- If you want to start over, see ["Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object"on page 245](#page-26-1).

## Creating a Copper Cut Out
Use copper cut outs to create voids inside copper shapes. Creating a cut out involves combining the fixed copper shape with the copper cut out.

SailWind Router does not provide a dedicated copper cut out button. Create cut outs by subtracting one copper shape from another.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A cut out does not create a void in the outline of the copper shape. Create the copper as a polygon shape to create features in the outline.
- You must be in Pour Outline mode (modeless command PO) to select or modify copper shapes.

**Prerequisites**

• You must put the cut out on the same layer as the copper.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the **Drafting Toolbar**, click the **Copper** button.
- 2. ["Create one or more cut out shapes"on page 226](#page-7-0) for the copper. You can create the cut out before the copper or the copper before the cut out.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Select Shapes** popup menu item.
- 4. Select the copper shape where you want to create the cut out.
- 5. Click the **Subtract Shapes** button.
- 6. Select the shape that you want to use as the copper cut out. The software removes copper inside the selected cut out area.
- 7. Verify the resulting cut out displays as expected.

## Creating Nested Copper
You can create a copper shape within another "outer" copper shape. You can do so by creating a copper cut out inside the outer shape, subtracting it from the outer shape, and then creating the new nested copper shape inside the copper cutout.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_9_Figure_11.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Prerequisites**

• You must be in Pour Outline mode (modeless command PO) to modify or select copper shapes.

**Procedure**

1. In the outer copper shape, ["create a copper cut out"on page 227](#page-8-0) of appropriate size and shape;

then subtract it from the outer shape by clicking the **Subtract Shapes** button. See ["Creating a](#page-8-0)  [Copper Cut Out"on page 227](#page-8-0) for more information on subtracting shapes.

2. [Create the new nested copper shapeon page 226](#page-7-0) within the copper cut out.

**Results**

The new nested copper shape displays inside the cut out of the outer shape.

## Filling a Shape with Solid Copper
If desired, you can fill a shape with solid copper. The copper shape appears solid when you enable the Pour Outline mode (modeless command PO).

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a copper shape, right-click, and then click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. In the "Copper Properties dialog box"on page 471, select the "Solid" check box.

If the check box is selected, whenever you enable the display of copper hatching, the copper shape displays as solid. When the check box is cleared, and you enable hatching, the copper drafting object fills according to the settings in the **Global** category > **General** subcategory of the "Options dialog box"on page 441.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_10_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Tip** Solid copper uses trace clearance rules.

## Creating a Copper Plane or Cut Out Manually
Use a copper plane to create a copper area that avoids objects not connected to the net assigned to the copper plane and makes thermal connections to objects that are connected to that net.

Copper planes are insulated from traces or pins that do not share the net name. Flooded copper planes create isolation areas around non-connecting pins and traces automatically.

Use copper cut outs to create voids inside copper shapes. Creating a cut out involves combining the fixed copper shape with the copper cut out.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A cut out does not create a void in the outline of the copper plane. See ["Creating](#page-27-0) Voids in Copper [Planes"on page 246](#page-27-0) for instructions on creating voids.
- If you create a copper plane cut out, you must put the cut out on the same layer as the copper plane.

**Video**

The following video demonstrates fundamental steps for creating and editing copper planes.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_11_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper Plane** or the **Copper Plane Cut Out** button.

The add command for that object type attaches to your pointer.

- 2. Right-click and click a command to change the values of the drafting object. For more information, see [Set Drafting Options Before Creating a Drafting Object](#page-4-0).
- 3. Create the shape using one of the following methods:
	- [Creating a Polygon Drafting Object](#page-12-0)
	- [Creating a Circle Drafting Object](#page-13-0)
	- [Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object](#page-13-1)
- 4. In the "Copper Plane Properties dialog box"on page 475 that appears, assign a net by selecting the net name in the Net list and any other appropriate changes to the copper plane properties. When you create a copper plane on a split/mixed layer, you can select the "Show plane nets only" check box to limit the nets to only those assigned to the split/mixed plane layer.
- 5. Click **OK**.
- 6. Review the resulting shape.
- If the shape edges are not correct, see ["Edge Precision of Drafting Shapes"on page 224](#page-5-0).
- If the shape needs to be modified, see ["Drafting Object Properties"on page 244.](#page-25-0)
- If you want to start over, see ["Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object"on page 245](#page-26-1).

## Creating a Polygon Drafting Object
Use the polygon drafting tool to draw the shape of a copper plane, void, or cut out.

**Procedure**

1. On the Drafting Toolbar, click the **Copper**, **Keepout**, **Copper Plane**, or the **Copper Plane Cut Out**  button.

The add command for that object type attaches to your pointer.

- 2. Right-click and choose the **Polygon** popup menu item.
- 3. To start the drafting object and finish each segment or place each corner, use one of the following:
	- Locate each coordinate with the pointer, and click to start and indicate consecutive corners.
	- Type S<x> <y>, where <x> and <y> are the coordinate values for the starting point and consecutive corners; then click to draw the segment.
	- Type SR<x> <y> if you want to specify relative coordinate values for each point and corner; then click to draw the segment.

**Tip** Right-click and choose the **Add Arc** popup menu item to add an arc instead of a straightline segment.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_12_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Note:**

You can press the Backspace key to remove the last corner entered. You can also press Esc key to cancel the operation.

4. Double-click or right-click and choose the **Complete** popup menu item to end the shape.

## Merge Shapes
Merge Shapes is used to combine two or more shapes (coppers, copper planes, or copper plane cutouts) into a single merged shape. Each location where a shape intersects another shape results in a single shape that expands to include the additional shapes.

The shapes merge into a single shape, which inherits the properties (such as width, net name, and fill type) of the last shape selected. Additionally, if you merge a copper plane with a copper plane cutout, then the merged shape is of the same type of the last shape selected. For example, if you select the copper plane cutout last, the resulting merged shape is a copper plane cutout.

**Prerequisites**

- You must select two (or more) shapes before merging shapes.
- You must be in Pour Outline mode (modeless command PO) to select and modify copper shapes. Use the modeless PO command to toggle the setting.
- You cannot merge copper shapes with copper planes.
- The shapes need to reside on the same layer.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_14_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Note:**

If two or more shapes are selected and they are assigned to different net names then the merge is not completed.

- The shapes need to intersect at one (or more) locations to merge.
- You cannot merge shapes if they belong to a physical design reuse.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use Ctrl-click to select two or more existing shapes.
- 2. On the Drafting toolbar, click the **Merge Shapes** button, or right-click and click the **Merge Shapes**  popup menu item.

The selected shapes are merged into a single shape.

[Subtract Shapes](#page-15-0)

## Subtract Shapes
Subtract Shapes is used to subtract one shape from another resulting in a single merged shape. This is not restricted to copper plane cutout shapes; a copper plane can be subtracted from a copper plane or a copper shape can be subtracted from another copper shape for ease of use.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- A shape subtracted from another shape that completely severs the first shape results in two separate shapes.
- A shape completely within a plane which is subtracted is treated as a void and combined with the plane so that it moves with the plane (unlike a cutout which tracks separately). Subtracting the shape may not be the best choice in this case and it may be better to keep it as a cutout so the void shape can be more easily moved or copied. The copper plane will have an opening in the flooded shape either way.
- You must be in Pour Outline mode (modeless command PO) to select and modify copper shapes. Use the modeless PO command to toggle the setting.
- You cannot subtract a copper shape from a copper plane or a copper plane from a copper shape.
- You cannot subtract shapes if they belong to a physical design reuse.
- If subtracting a copper shape from another results in two or more separate copper shapes, each shape receives a new name and a new origin.

**Prerequisites**

- The shapes need to reside on the same layer.
- The shapes need to intersect.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a single copper, copper plane, or copper plane cutout shape.
- 2. On the Drafting toolbar, click the **Subtract Shapes** button or right-click and click the **Subtract Shapes** popup menu item.

The base shape (the shape from which you intend subtract another shape) displays with a colored dashed outline. Other shapes that are available for selection appear with a solid colored outline, while unavailable objects in the design change to gray scale, thus making it easy to discern between objects.

3. Select another single shape to subtract from the first shape.

The function does not allow multiple shapes to be selected as subtraction operations can result in different effects depending on the order of subtraction.

The selected shape is subtracted from the first shape. Repeat to subtract additional shapes as required.

4. When you have finished subtracting shapes press the Esc key or right-click and click the **Cancel**  popup menu item to end the procedure.

## Cut Outs Absorbed by Copper
When you combine coppers and copper cut outs in SailWind Layout and take the design into SailWind Router, if any cut outs cross the copper outline after you, they are no longer cut outs. Instead, the software absorbs them into the copper shape.

In some cases, copper cut outs are completely enclosed within the confines of a copper shape. If the copper cut out extends beyond the boundaries of the copper shape, however, and you merge the cut out with the copper shape in SailWind Layout (by right-clicking and clicking the **Combine** popup menu item), when you move the design over to SailWind Router, the software "absorbs" it into the outline of the copper shape.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 46. Absorbed Copper Cut Out**

If the cut out completely divides a copper shape, two or more separate copper shapes may result in SailWind Router.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 47. Subtracted Copper Cut Outs in SailWind Router**

Certain other changes take place:

- If you completely cover a copper shape with a cut out then combine the two, taking the design into SailWind Router deletes the copper shape in its entirety.
- SailWind Router removes any copper cut outs that lie outside the boundary of a copper shape.
- If a copper shape has two or more overlapping cut outs within its boundaries, the copper cut outs merge into one shape when you move the design to SailWind Router.

The software generates a report automatically when you open the design, detailing any instances where the software absorbs one or more shapes during the subtraction process.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Note:**

If SailWind Router is running in the foreground, the link to the report displays in the SailWind Router Output Window. If SailWind Router is running in the background (for example, during an autoroute routine or during Latium Design Verification), the link to the report displays in the SailWind Layout Output Window.

## Self-Intersecting Polygons
A self-intersecting polygon occurs whenever a portion of a shape outline overlaps with another portion of the same shape. Giving a polygon a large outline width can cause the outline to overlap in some portions.

When drafting copper planes and shapes using polygons, you can set the outline line width in the Copper Plane Properties dialog boxon page 475. Choosing a narrow line width enables you to create shapes with greater accuracy in detailed areas, as shown in [Figure 48](#page-19-0).

![](/router/guide/15/_page_19_Figure_1.jpeg)

You can set the line width as required for your design; however, as the width increases, the shape resolution decreases. Referring to the example in the preceding figure, as the outline line width of a copper shape increases, the outer edge of the lines remain in place and the inner edges expand inward. The result appears in [Figure 49.](#page-20-0)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_20_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 49. Shape Detail with Increased Line Width**

If you set the outline line width too wide, the centerlines of two edge segments may overlap one another, resulting in a self-intersecting polygon.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_21_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/15/_page_21_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Note:**

The overlap is most visible when you turn on copper flooding.

Keep in mind that a self-intersecting polygon can occur with planes created from the board outline shape when the plane area shrinks by the clearance value. Similarly, a self-intersecting polygon can also occur when using the auto separate functionality because of the auto separate gap.

## Modification of Drafting Objects
After adding drafting objects to a design, you can move, edit, or delete them as your design needs change.

The following video demonstrates fundamental steps for modifying drafting objects.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_22_Picture_4.jpeg)

[Moving a Drafting Object](#page-22-1) [Modifying Drafting Object Segment Properties](#page-23-0) [Modifying Drafting Corner Properties](#page-23-1) [Setting the Origin of a Drafting Object](#page-24-0) [Drafting Object Properties](#page-25-0) [Pulling an Arc from a Drafting Segment/Corner](#page-25-1) [Deleting a Drafting Segment or Object](#page-26-1)

### Moving a Drafting Object
You can move a whole drafting object while maintaining its shape.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• You cannot modify, move, or delete a polygon that is part of a physical design reuse.

**Procedure**

1. Select the drafting object to move using one of the following methods:

![](/router/guide/15/_page_22_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:** You must turn off flooding before you can select a shape.

- With nothing selected, right-click and choose the **Select Shapes** popup menu item; then click on a segment of the object. (The *Select Shapes* selection filter setting is the best filter for selecting a drafting object.)
- Select a segment of the object, right-click, and then choose the **Select Shape** popup menu item.
- Shift-click a segment of the object.
- 2. Right-click and choose the **Move** popup menu item. Alternatively, you can drag the selected object, if allowed by your Drag moves settingon page 441.

The shape attaches to the cursor by the Move preference settingon page 441.

- 3. If you need to make additional changes to the drafting shape before you move it, right-click and choose the **Rotate 90**, **Rotate Group 90**, **Spin**, **Flip Horizontal**, or **Flip Vertical** popup menu items.
- 4. Move the drafting object to its new location and click to place it.

### Modifying Drafting Object Segment Properties
You can edit or change the properties of copper shape, keepout, copper plane, and copper plane cut out segments.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click **Select Anything** as your selection filter.
- 2. Click a copper, keepout, copper plane, or copper cut out segment to select it.
- 3. Right-click and choose the **Properties** popup menu item. The "Copper Segment dialog box"on page 478, "Keepout Segment Properties dialog box"on page 496, Copper Plane Segment dialog box, or the Copper Cut Out Segment Properties dialog boxon page 474 opens, displaying the drafting object type, coordinates, and dimensions.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_23_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** Some of the options in this dialog box are unavailable if the segment is part of a physical design reuse.

4. Modify the segment coordinates and arc settings as desired; then click **OK**.

### Modifying Drafting Corner Properties
You can edit or change the properties of drafting object corners, such as location.

**Procedure**

	- Right-click and choose the **Delete** popup menu item.

**Tip** You cannot modify, move, or delete a polygon that is part of a physical design reuse.

## Copper Voids
Voids in copper planes represent gaps or missing areas in the copper fill. You can create and delete voids as necessary to accommodate any changes required to the copper plane.

A void is an integral part of the copper plane, and it behaves as part of the plane. If you move the plane, for example, the void moves with it. Conversely, a copper plane cut out is separate from the plane. Although you can select and move a cut out, you cannot move it by moving the copper plane.

Voids and cut outs appear the same when you flood the copper plane.

**Figure 51. Voids in a Copper Plane Before and After Flooding**

![](/router/guide/15/_page_26_Figure_16.jpeg)

You create a void in a copper plane by subtracting one enclosed polygon from within another. You can remove a void later by deleting it. For more information, see ["Creating](#page-27-0) Voids in Copper Planes" [on](#page-27-0)  [page 246.](#page-27-0)

If you subtract a copper plane cutout from a copper plane, it becomes a void.

## Creating Voids in Copper Planes
You can subtract a copper plane from another copper plane to create a void. You can also delete that void later if desired.

**Prerequisites**

• Place the software in copper plane outline mode by turning off copper plane hatching (using the Pour Outline (PO) command). If you do not turn off copper plane hatching, the shapes you create within a copper plane appear to be voids but the software treats them as cut outs instead.

**Video**

The following video demonstrates how to create copper planes and voids.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_27_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Procedure**

1. Create the outline of the void by drawing another copper plane or cut out within the boundaries of the first copper plane. You can create a polygon, circle, or rectangle by right-clicking and choosing the desired shape from the popup menu.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_27_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:**

You must draw the void within the boundaries of the first copper plane or the software cannot qualify it as a void.

- a. In the Copper Plane Properties dialog box, ensure the shape of the intended void is on the same layer as the copper plane.
- b. Click **OK**.
- 2. Press the Esc key to exit the copper plane drawing mode.
- 3. Click the outline of the copper plane to select it; then, on the Drafting Operations toolbar, click the **Subtract Shapes** button.

Alternatively, right-click and choose **Subtract Shapes** from the popup menu item.

Either method places the software in shape subtraction mode, as indicated by a dashed line highlighting the copper plane.

- 4. Click the shape you want to use as the void. You can select more than one shape.
- 5. Press the Esc key to exit the shape subtraction mode when you are finished selecting shapes.
- 6. Enable copper plane hatching using the Pour Outline (PO) command and verify the void is formed properly.

## Creating Nested Copper Planes
You can create a copper plane within another "outer" copper plane. You create a copper void inside the outer shape and then create the new nested copper plane inside the copper cut out.

![](/router/guide/15/_page_28_Picture_20.jpeg)

**Note:**

You can alternatively create a distinct, nested shape by giving it a different flooding priority than the underlying copper plane. See "Options Dialog Box, Flooding Category"on page 447.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the outer copper shape, ["create a copper void"on page 246](#page-27-0) of appropriate size and shape within the outer shape.
- 2. [Create the new nested copper planeon page 229](#page-10-1) within the copper void.

**Results**

The new nested copper plane appears inside the void of the outer copper plane.

## Selection of Drafting Objects
Drafting objects are made up of the line segment outlines and sometimes fill. At times, you want to select a segment, and at other times, you need to select the whole outline.
