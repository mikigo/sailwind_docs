# **Chapter 13 Place Components**

SailWind Router provides a comprehensive selection of placement commands that allow very precise positioning of components. SailWind Router also has commands that allow you to move, flip, rotate, and spin components during or after initial placement.

# <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Placing Components**

Use placement commands to move components on a board.

SailWind Router's component placement commands differ slightly from those in SailWind Layout. Familiarize yourself with the placement rules and options to fully understand placement commands and results.

You can modify component placement manually or you can edit component properties. To manually place a component or component group, you use a combination of pointer operations and Move, Spin, Rotate, and Flip commands. To edit a component or component group's placement, you modify the X/Y location, rotation, or layer properties in the **Component** tab of the Component Properties dialog box.

The component's origin snaps to the Placement grid during placement operations except in the following cases:

- You place the component using the Spin command.
- You place the component by editing its X/Y or rotation properties.
- You clear the Snap check box for the Placement grid on the **Grid** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.

You can move components after you set options and preferences defining how you want to move them and how you want to perform DRC. You can also spin components, rotate them by 90 degrees, or flip them to the other side of the board.

Use the Placement toolbar to activate placement commands.

**Tip** Placement commands are also available in Object mode from the shortcut menu when you rightclick over a selected component.

In general, the placement commands behave like SailWind Layout placement commands. The following list summarizes the main placement behaviors that are different in this program:

- Set an origin for a component or component group.
- Spin, rotate, and flip a component group as a whole, using one origin for the entire group.
- Rotate components counter-clockwise, regardless of the side of the board on which the component resides.
- Set the angular increment value for Spin.
- Reroute during placement.
- Prevented from moving unions, reuses, arrays, an arbitrary set of components and traces, coppers, texts, 2D-lines, or keepouts.

**Tip** You can place a component by editing its properties. Modify the X/Y location, rotation, or layer properties in the **Component** tab of the Component Properties dialog box.

### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Component Placement Rules**

During placement operations, components adhere to specific rules that define clearances between design objects.

Clearance between two components is defined as the minimum distance between the component placement outlines. During placement operations, SailWind Router checks the clearance between a selected component and other components for the following object relationships:

- Component-to-component clearance
- Component-to-board outline clearance
- Component-to-board cutout outline clearance

The software takes measurements from the centerline of the line used to create the component placement outline to the following:

- The centerline of another component placement outline
- The centerline of the board outline
- The centerline of a line defining a board cutout

**Figure 31. Example Placement Outlines**

The SailWind Layout Decal Editor enables you to use 2D lines to create a representation of the component placement outline on Layer 20. The software recognizes these placement outlines as follows:

- When a part is brought into a design in SailWind Layout, this outline converts from a group of 2D lines into a Placement Outline design object on Layer 20. Visibility is controlled by color tiles on Layer 20 in the Top/Bottom Object columns of the Display Colors dialog box.
- When the design opens in SailWind Router, the software recognizes this Placement Outline object on Layer 20 and converts it to a SailWind Router Placement Outline object whose visibility is controlled separately by color tiles in the Top Plc. or Bot. Plc. columns in the **Options** menu item, Colors category. The Placement Outline design object visibility is no longer associated with Layer 20.
- If no Layer 20 Placement Outline is detected for a component, the system auto-generates an outline that encompasses all of the objects in the pcb decal. The software recognizes it as a SailWind Router Placement Outline object whose visibility is also controlled separately by color tiles in the Top Plc. or Bot. Plc. columns in the **Options** menu item, Colors category.
- Placement Outline objects derived from Layer 20 Placement Outlines and auto-generated Placement Outline objects are treated equally in SailWind Router, and no distinctions are drawn between them by the DRC or Design Verification processes.
- The auto-generated SailWind Router Placement Outline design objects are temporary for the current design session. When the design returns to SailWind Layout, the software removes these design objects from the database. The visibility of any Layer 20 Placement Outline design objects revert back to control by Layer 20 in SailWind Layout.

During placement operations, SailWind Router checks both the height of the selected component and the keepout height settings. If you place a component into a keepout, and the height of the component exceeds the height setting of the keepout, a placement DRC violation is reported.

**Tip** Using the Layout Editor in SailWind Layout, you can set the geometry of a component height keepout on the primary component side, the secondary component side, or both sides of the board. You can edit the height of the keepout by editing its properties.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Placing Components and DRC**

SailWind Router checks design rules between placed components and other objects but does not check design rules between objects on the placed component or component group. When you use Move or Spin, placement-only DRC violations appear highlighted before you complete the placement.

**Tip**

No design rule checking occurs for a component or component group that you place completely outside of the board outline. However, design rule checking does occur if you place the component or component group partly or entirely inside the board outline.

When a DRC violation occurs, the Error Response setting in the Design Rule Checking dialog box determines how the placement command completes and it reports the violation.

| Error response | Placement response to DRC violation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | DRC violation reporting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### **Table 61. Effects of Error Response Setting**

**Tip**

When more than one Error Response list setting is selected in the Design Rule Checking dialog box, the setting with the highest priority applies. "Prevent" has the highest priority and "Warn" has the lowest priority.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Setting Fabrication Rules to Control Placement**

You can set the minimum spacing between components clearance value and the default component height limits.

![](/router/_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** You cannot place a component if its distance to another component is less than the "Minimum spacing between components" clearance value that you set in the **Options** menu item, Fabrication category.

**Tip** If you set a Geometry.Height attribute for a component in SailWind Layout, you cannot place the component in SailWind Router if the attribute value exceeds the height you set in the **Options**  menu item, Fabrication category.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the Fabrication category.
- 2. In the Component assembly area, specify placement rule settings.
- 3. Click **OK** to accept the settings and close the Options dialog box.

![](/router/_page_4_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** To enable placement rule checking, on the DRC Filter Toolbar, select Placement, and then, in the Design Rule Checking dialog box, set the desired response action.

# <span id="page-4-1"></span>**Adding Keepouts**

You can add keepout areas to your design to define areas where design objects cannot be placed. You can create keepout areas using closed polygons (with or without arcs), circles, or rectangles. The current angle mode and design grid settings determine the placement of the lines.

Keepout areas you create in SailWind Router transfer with the design when you open it in SailWind Layout.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Drafting Operations** toolbar button.
- 2. On the Drafting Operations toolbar, click the Keepout button.
- 3. Create one of the following shapes for the keepout area:
	- Creating a Polygon Drafting Object
	- Creating a Circle Drafting Object
	- Creating a Rectangle Drafting Object
- 4. In the "Keepout Properties dialog box"on page 495 that appears, specify the layer where you want to place the keepout area and the restrictions that you want to apply.

#### **Restriction:**

When you choose layer assignments, if a restriction is not available for that layer, its corresponding check box is unavailable. For example, if you choose a non-placement layer, the Placement check box is not available.

#### 5. Click **OK**.

The software creates the keepout. If you create other keepouts, they use the restrictions you set here as the default.

#### **Results**

The keepout displays with the hatch filling selected in the Options dialog box > Global category > "General subcategory"on page 441.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Moving Routed Components**

SailWind Router manipulates the traces attached to the pins of a placed component according to the Move Fanouts and the Reroute Traces settings in the **Placement** tab of the Options dialog box. When you enable the Move Fanout setting, SailWind Router places the traces and vias recognized as fanout with the component.

The following figure shows a selected component and its fanout.

#### **Figure 32. Fanout of a Selected Component**

![](/router/_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

The "Move components with Fanout" setting has priority over the Reroute Mode setting. If you select the "Move components with Fanout" check box, the fanout traces and vias move with the component. In contrast, if you clear the check box, the fanout traces and vias are subject to the Reroute Mode setting.

If SailWind Router cannot route the nets free of DRC violations, and you set the Error Response setting in the Design Rule Checking dialog box to "Prevent" or "Explain," it leaves the nets unrouted. However, if you set the Error Response setting to "Warn," the software routes in a straight rat's nest pattern any nets that it cannot otherwise reroute free of DRC violations.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Setting the Placement Origin**

You can change the placement origin for a component or component group.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the Global category > General subcategory.
- 2. In the "Object movement" area, click the "Move object by" list and select "Origin."
- 3. Click **OK**.
- 4. On the Placement toolbar, click the **Select Mode** button.
- 5. Select the component or component group.
- 6. Right-click and click the **Set Move Origin** popup menu item.
- 7. Move the pointer and click to set the new origin.

The origin you specify applies only for the current selection. When you make a new selection, the move origin reverts to its original location on the component.

If you do not specify a new origin, SailWind Router uses the original origin of the selected component. If you select a group of components, the software calculates the origin as the lower left of the selected group.

8. Click **Yes** to confirm the new origin or click **No** to select another origin.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Placing Members of a Component Group**

If you use the Move, Spin, Rotate, or Flip commands with a component group, the component group origin becomes the focal point for the placement operation while relative positions among members remain unchanged. In contrast, if you edit the component properties, the individual component origins become focus points for placement operations and the relative positions among members of the component group do change.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>[Figure 33](#page-7-1)and [Figure 34](#page-7-2)show how the Rotate command places the members of a component group.

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>**Measuring Distance Between Objects**

You can measure the distance between components to aid in accurate placement.

Use either of the following methods to measure the distance between objects:

[Measuring Distance Between Objects Using In-Place Query](#page-16-1) [Measuring Distance Between Objects Using the Q Shortcut Key](#page-16-2)

### <span id="page-16-1"></span>**Measuring Distance Between Objects Using In-Place Query**

In-place Query allows you to measure the distance between components by selecting the objects.

### **Procedure**

- 1. On the main toolbar, click the **In-Place Query** button.
- 2. Select an object.
- 3. Point to a second object.

<span id="page-16-3"></span>The shortest distance between the objects appears, as shown in [Figure 37](#page-16-3)

**Figure 37. Distance Measured from the Via on the Left to the Via on the Right**

![](/router/_page_16_Picture_13.jpeg)

### <span id="page-16-2"></span>**Measuring Distance Between Objects Using the Q Shortcut Key**

The Q shortcut key attaches a measurement line to the pointer and displays dx, dy, and hypotenuse information, depending on pointer movement. It snaps to the routing grid when Grid Snap is on. When Grid Snap is off, the Q shortcut key makes the measurements without the grid.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Locate the pointer over the first object.
- 2. Press the q key and click **Execute**.
- 3. Locate the pointer over the second object to display the dx, dy, and hypotenuse ("d") information.

![](/router/_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Tip** Click to restart the measurement.
