## Setting Up Trace Editing
After you complete routing a design, you may want to edit traces or areas of the board. Before you start to edit the traces, set up editing options that help control trace editing.

For more information, see Options Dialog Box, Routing Category, General Subcategory.

**Tip** You cannot edit protected objects, elements of physical design reuses, or jumpers.

[Showing Clearances Around Obstacles](#page-1-1) [Plowing](#page-1-2) Traces [Remove Overlapping Segments](#page-1-3)

### Showing Clearances Around Obstacles
You can view the minimum clearance around obstacles with transparent, colored outlines that surround them on the display. These outlines, called *guard bands*, point out obstacles to objects as you route or edit them. Guard bands also show the minimum distance you must maintain between objects.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the "Display settings" area, select the "Show guard bands on object" check box.

### Plowing Traces
If desired, you can enable SailWind Router to push and shove other traces while you make edits.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Routing**  category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the Plower area, select the "Turn on plower" check box. SailWind Router maintains the Plower settings automatically during editing operations. For more information, see "Interactive Routing Setup"on page 291.

### Remove Overlapping Segments
If you create an overlapping segment when editing a trace, SailWind Router automatically removes the overlap.

The following figure illustrates this principle:

**Figure 89. Overlapping Segments Removed**

![](/router/guide/20/_page_2_Figure_2.jpeg)

## Changing the Routing Angle Mode
Editing operations automatically maintain the current routing angle. However, you can change the routing angle mode temporarily while editing a trace corner.

For example, if you add or move a segment corner, and the routing angle mode is Diagonal, the selected segment corner moves on a diagonal grid, and adjacent traces move in correspondence, as shown in the following figure.

**Figure 90. Editing Tracesâ€” Routing Angle Mode**

![](/router/guide/20/_page_2_Picture_7.jpeg)

If desired, you can temporarily change the routing angle mode to Orthogonal to make an edit.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

SailWind Router does not maintain the routing angle when adding or moving a corner.

- 1. Select a trace segment corner for editing, right-click, and choose the **Move** popup menu item.
- 2. While moving the corner, right-click and choose the **Routing Angle** popup menu option, then click the angle mode you want to use. As an alternative, use the AO, AD, or AA shortcut keys.

3. To temporarily change the routing angle, while editing, press Shift. This overrides the current routing angle. If you are in Orthogonal or Diagonal mode, you switch to Any Angle. If you are in Any Angle mode, you switch to Diagonal. When you release the Shift key, you return to the original routing angle mode.

## Edit Traces Using DRC Modes
Editing operations automatically maintain current DRC settings. For example, if the DRC mode is set to Prevent, and an attempt to complete an editing operation creates a violation, you cannot complete the editing operation.

You can use three temporary DRC modes to help complete editing operations. During editing operations, you can access temporary DRC modes by use of a right-click menu.

The temporary DRC modes available for editing operations are as follows:

- **Ignore Clearance**  Temporarily disables clearance checking, which may make it possible to complete an editing operation.
- **Check Clearance During Move**  Checks clearance during editing. This option is mutually exclusive with the Check Clearance By Click mode.
- **Check Clearance By Click**  Checks clearance after you click to complete the editing operation; for example, when you click to indicate the new location of a moved trace. This option is mutually exclusive with the Check Clearance During Move mode.

In addition, you can right-click and choose the **Explain Last Error** popup menu item for additional information on any errors you encounter.

**Related Topics**

Setting Design Rule Checking

## Stretch Traces and Arcs
The Stretch command shrinks and stretches trace objects, including arcs, trace segments, trace paths, and trace corners. SailWind Router pushes and shoves movable obstacles during stretch operations if you select the "Turn on plower" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory).

SailWind Router removes hatch outlines when you stretch traces.

When you stretch trace corners, the corners convert to miters, as shown in below.

**Figure 91. Stretching Trace Corners**

![](/router/guide/20/_page_4_Figure_6.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/20/_page_4_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Note:**

If a selected trace corner is also a virtual point, you cannot stretch the corner.

[Stretching](#page-4-1) Trace Objects [Stretching Arcs](#page-4-2)

### Stretching Trace Objects
You can stretch traces or traces segments.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot stretch a corner that has arcs attached to it.

**Procedure**

1. Select an object then right-click and click either **Stretch** or **Stretch Adjacent Segments** popup menu item.

**Restriction:**

The Stretch Adjacent Segments option appears only if you select a trace corner to move.

2. You can stretch trace segments or trace corners. Move the pointer to the new location and click to complete the stretch.

### Stretching Arcs
You can stretch arcs or trace corners into arcs.

- 1. Select an object then right-click and click the **Stretch Arc** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer to the new location for the arc and click to complete the stretch. As a recommended practice, protect traces containing arcs before stretching them, as stretching a trace segment attached to an arc may remove arc corners.

## Reroute Traces
You can change the pattern of an existing trace, or create a new pattern for a trace, a trace segment, or an unroute.

SailWind Router automatically removes hatch outlines when you reroute traces.

[Rerouting with Interactive Routing](#page-6-1) [Rerouting with Quick Route](#page-6-2) [Rerouting with Split](#page-7-0)

### Rerouting with Interactive Routing
You can choose to reroute a trace interactively as one of the many editing options in SailWind Router.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the trace, via, trace corner, or trace segment to reroute at the point from which you want to start rerouting.
- 2. Reroute the trace, creating a new trace as described in "Creating Traces" on page 304. If you have trouble completing the trace, check the following:
	- Trace sharing settings of the net to which you are routing in the "Allow junctions on" area (**Topology** tab of the Net Properties or Design Properties dialog box). If you disable the sharing settings, you may not be able to complete the trace.
	- The "Allow loops when rerouting" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory).
- 3. Double-click along another point in the same trace or net to complete the reroute. SailWind Router removes loops in the trace unless you select the "Allow Loops when Rerouting" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory). Clicking **Complete** when rerouting a previously complete trace has no effect. For more information, see "Design Rule Checking and Interactive Routing"on page 297.

### Rerouting with Quick Route
The Quick Route feature lets you reroute a trace by defining a new trace pattern and then smoothing it. The Quick Route feature is useful when you make changes that result in a new path around an obstacle.

If you select the "Smooth traces on complete" check box in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory, the newly rerouted trace pattern is automatically smoothed upon completion. However, if the new trace pattern does not differ widely from the original pattern, the smoothed trace is likely to resemble the original. For this reason, Quick Route is most useful when creating a new path around an obstacle. An example of Quick Route rerouting appears in the following figure.

**Figure 92. Quick Route Rerouting**

![](/router/guide/20/_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

Quick Route uses the push away feature. Traces are pushed away from obstacles regardless of whether you selected the "Push segments away from obstacles" box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory).

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace then right-click and click the **Quick Route** popup menu item. Alternatively, on the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Quick Route** button.
- 2. Move the pointer in the direction of the new trace pattern. You cannot change the layer of the trace or add vias while using Quick Route.
- 3. Click to enter any corners as you redefine the trace pattern.
- 4. When you get near the completion point, right-click and click the **Complete** menu item.

### Rerouting with Split
Split divides trace segments into multiple segments by adding corners. The same segments or paths remain selected so you can add more corners.

You can split trace segments or trace paths.

- 1. Select an object, right-click and click the **Split Trace Segments** popup menu item.
- 2. Click to indicate new corners.
- 3. Double-click when you finish redefining the trace pattern.

## Trace Smoothing
Smooth trace patterns to remove unnecessary corners or reduce length. Trace smoothing frees up room on the board for additional traces and helps meet and maintain pad entry and first corner rules.

Smoothing is a single layer glossing operation. Smooth traces does not remove vias.

Smoothing converts arcs to line segments. Protect arcs before smoothing traces that contain arcs.

[Smoothing](#page-8-1) Traces While Routing or Rerouting [Smoothing](#page-8-2) Traces While Plowing [Smoothing](#page-9-0) Existing Traces

### Smoothing Traces While Routing or Rerouting
You can choose to smooth traces as the routing process completes them.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then in the Options dialog box, click the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Select the "Smooth traces on complete" check box then click **OK**. Smoothing occurs as you complete traces during either interactive routing or editing.

### Smoothing Traces While Plowing
You can smooth obstructing traces as they are shoved during editing operations.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then in the Options dialog box, click the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the "Plower" area, select the "Plow traces smoothly" check box.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_8_Figure_16.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/20/_page_8_Figure_17.jpeg)

**Related Topics**

Interactive Routing Setup

### Smoothing Existing Traces
You can smooth traces, trace segments, trace paths, and differential pair traces.

- 1. Select a trace then right-click and click the **Smooth Trace Pattern** popup menu item.
- 2. If you select a differential pair, right-click and click the **Diff Pair Smooth** popup menu item. When smoothing differential pairs, select the entire differential pair. If you only select one of the traces in the pair, the single trace may be smoothed if the matching trace in the pair is not found, thus invalidating the differential pair.

## Change Trace Width
You can change the width of traces both while interactively routing and after traces are complete. For example, you can change the width of a trace if its current width is an obstacle to completing the trace. By using a smaller trace width, you can complete the trace without violating design rules.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot change the width of differential pair traces when routing in the controlled gap area.

Changing Trace Width While Routing [Interactively](#page-10-1) [Changing](#page-10-2) the Width of Existing Traces

### Changing Trace Width While Routing Interactively
If necessary, you can change the width of a trace while routing interactively. You can either select a new trace width from a list or type a specific width.

**Procedure**

1. While routing, right-click, choose the **Width** popup menu item, and either click a width or click **Set**  to type a width.

Alternatively, press the W key during interactive routing to specify a width to apply. The list of widths that appears includes the last widths set using the W shortcut key, and the minimum, recommended, and maximum widths (according to design rules).

While routing with a reduced width, an indicator appears at the pointer. This indicator shows you when you can return to the previous trace width.

- 2. Click to continue routing the trace at the previous trace width.
- 3. If you are plowing while routing, objects move out of the way to accommodate a larger trace width.

### Changing the Width of Existing Traces
You can change the width of traces, trace segments, trace paths, nets, and pin pairs.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace that has a widths that you want to change.
- 2. Right-click, choose the **Width** popup menu item, and click either a width from the list or click **Set** to type a width. This list contains the recently used widths followed by the minimum, recommended, and maximum trace widths.

Alternatively, click a trace and press the W key to apply a specific width.

**Results**

If the plower is enabled, movable trace objects move to accommodate the new width.

## Converting a Trace to an Arc
You can convert the existing traces and trace corners to arcs. You can also change the radius of an arc.

[Converting](#page-11-1) Existing Traces to Arcs [Converting Corners to Arcs](#page-11-2) [Changing the Radius of an Arc](#page-11-3)

### Converting Existing Traces to Arcs
You can convert existing traces, trace segments, and trace paths to arcs.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace segment then right-click and click the **Create/Modify Arc** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer to define the radius of the arc.
- 3. Click to complete the arc. Alternatively, right-click and click the **Finish** popup menu item.

### Converting Corners to Arcs
You can convert a corner to an arc by using the Stretch Arc command. The Stretch Arc command converts any trace segment that has convergent adjacent segments. You can create an arc with end points that are not tangent to adjacent segments. Adjacent segments stretch but retain their current angle. Using Stretch Arc automatically disables the "Push segments away from obstacles" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory).

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- You cannot use Stretch Arc on segments with vias at the end points.
- You cannot use Stretch Arc on segments that have an arc or a partially routed trace as an end point.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a corner then right-click and click the **Stretch Arc** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer to stretch the arc to the correct location.
- 3. Click to create the arc.

### Changing the Radius of an Arc
You can adjust the radius of an existing arc. When modifying an existing arc, you cannot change the end points of the arc segment; they are fixed.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select an arc then right-click and click the **Create/Modify Arc** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer to define the radius of the arc. You can also return the arc to a trace segment.
- 3. Click to complete the arc.

## Moving Trace Objects
You can move trace objects, including trace segments, corners, T-junctions, vias, trace end points, and arcs. When you move a T-junction or a via, SailWind Router maintains pad entry rules, regardless of design rules or DRC modes.

If you select the "Smooth adjacent segments" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory), SailWind Router smooths adjacent trace segments as you move any trace object, except corners. When you move corners, it does not smooth adjacent segments.

When you move trace segments, adjacent segments do not move. Instead, SailWind Router adds new segments.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_12_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 94. Moving Trace Segments**

**Procedure**

1. Select a trace object then right-click and click the **Move** menu item.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_12_Picture_13.jpeg)

2. To change the routing angle mode, right-click and choose the **Routing Angle** popup menu item; then click **Orthogonal**, **Diagonal**, or **Any Angle**.

Alternatively, use the AO, AD, or AA shortcut keys.

3. Move the pointer to the new location for the object, and click to complete the move.

## Moving Traces to Other Layers
You can move traces, trace segments, nets, paths, and pin pairs to other layers. When you select pin pairs or nets, all trace segments in the pin pair or net move to the new layer, regardless of their current layer. The same is true when you move multiple trace segments. If necessary, SailWind Router adds or removes vias of the current via type automatically when you change layers. SailWind Router does not, however, remove protected vias or vias set up as test points.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot move a protected trace or any portion of the protected trace.

**Procedure**

1. Select the objects to move.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_13_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** Before changing layers, press Alt while scrolling the wheel button on the mouse to preview layers.

2. Right-click, choose the **Layer** popup menu item, and click to select a layer from the list or click **Choose** to move to a layer that does not appear in the list.

The list contains the most recently visited, valid layers followed by other valid layers. If selected objects have conflicting layer biasing rules, invalid layers are not presented. If plowing is enabled, movable trace objects on the new layer are plowed to accommodate the new trace segments.

**Results**

When moving traces to other layers while the DRC modeon page 405 is set to Prevent:

- SailWind Router adjusts trace widths to support conditional rules on the new layer.
- Layer changes are cancel automatically if the layer change results in DRC violations.

Moving Trace [Objects](#page-12-0)

## Move Accordions
SailWind Router does not treat accordions as objects in the database; it treats them as a collection of trace segments. You can therefore move the trace segments, not the entire accordion.

For more information, see "Moving Trace [Objects](#page-12-0)."

## Deleting an Accordion
You can remove accordions while interactively routing the same way that you delete traces.

**Procedure**

While routing interactively, right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item or press the Esc key. While adding accordions, you can remove sections of the accordions by right-clicking and clicking the **Backup**  popup menu item or pressing the Backspace key. If you click **Backup** after you complete the accordion, SailWind Router removes the entire accordion.

**Related Topics**

Add Length to Traces

## Moving Arcs
When you move an arc, it does not modify the current shape; it modifies the position only.

- 1. Click on an arc then right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item. Alternatively, on the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Move** button.
- 2. To change the routing angle mode, right-click and choose the **Routing Angle** popup menu item; then click **Orthogonal**, **Diagonal**, or **Any Angle**.
- 3. Move the pointer to the new location for the arc and click to complete the move. If you select the "Smooth adjacent segments" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory), SailWind Router smooths adjacent trace segments as you move segments adjacent to the arc.

![](/router/guide/20/_page_14_Figure_16.jpeg)

## Deleting Arcs From Existing Traces
You can remove an arc from an existing trace and replace it with a trace segment.

**Procedure**

1. Click an arc to select it then press the Backspace key. Alternatively, right-click and choose the **Unroute** popup menu item.

SailWind Router removes the arc from the trace, leaving an unrouted gap between trace segments.

- 2. Select one of the trace segments to either side of the unrouted gap and click the **Interactive Route**  toolbar button or right-click and click the **Interactive Route** popup menu item.
- 3. Route a new trace between segments to complete the gap.

## Moving Corners
You can move corners from one place in the trace segment to another.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- If the trace corner or T-junction is also a virtual point, you cannot move the corner or T-junction to a location that creates a subnet violation.
- When moving corners, SailWind Router does not smooth adjacent segments even if you select the "Smooth adjacent segments" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory).

**Procedure**

- 1. Click a trace corner to select it then right-click and click the **Move** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer to the location at which to place the corner and click.

## Deleting Corners
You can delete corners while interactively routing.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot delete corners or T-junctions that are also virtual points.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select the corner and press the Backspace key to remove the corner and unroute the adjacent trace segments.
- 2. Alternatively, to delete a corner without unrouting the trace, select the corner then right-click and click the **Delete** popup menu item. Alternatively, press the Delete key.

SailWind Router removes the corner and replaces it with a straight trace segment. If the resulting trace segment encounters an obstacle, and you select the "Push segments away from obstacles" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory), the trace segment pushes away from the obstacle.

## Move Test Points
You can move a test point via just as you can move a via.

For more information, see "["Moving](#page-17-0) Vias[" on page 360.](#page-17-0)"

## Deleting Test Points
If desired, you can delete a test point from a pin or a via. However, in doing so, you delete only the test point assignment, not the via to which it is assigned.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a via or a pin that is a test point.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. Clear the "Serve as a test point" check box.
- 4. Click **OK**.

## Deleting Test Point Vias
You can remove a test point via from the design.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot delete a test point if you selected the Preserve Test Points box in the Options dialog box > **Test Points** subcategory.

**Procedure**

Select a test point via then right-click and click the **Delete** popup menu item.

## Unrouting Nets and Trace Segments
Unroute a net or trace segment to delete it. You can unroute nets, paths, pin pairs, vias, and trace segments. You cannot unroute protected objects.

**Prerequisites**

To unroute traces, you must first select the "Allow trace unrouting" check box (**Routing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box).

**Procedure**

Select an object then right-click and click the **Unroute** popup menu item.

**Tip** Unlike SailWind Layout, in SailWind Router, the Delete command removes a trace corner only. You must use the Unroute command in SailWind Router to unroute a trace.

**Results**

The unrouting command unroutes selected traces or traces connected to selected objects. The result of unrouting varies depending on the object you select:

- **Pin pair**  Unroutes the trace segment between the pin pair.
- **Net**  Unroutes the entire net trace.
- **Pin**  Deletes the trace segment entering the pin.
- **Component**  Deletes the trace segment entering each pin of the component.
- **Traces** Unroutes the selected trace segment. When you unroute a trace, trace segment, or trace corner, adjacent vias are deleted.
- **Protected Objects**  Cannot be deleted. You cannot unroute protected objects. If you try to unroute them, an error message appears. You can click on the text link in the message to zoom to the trace, via, or jumper location. Use the object's Properties dialog box to unglue it. For more information see ""Design Rules"on page 154."
- **Objects with a No Rip Up Rule**  Cannot be unrouted. The no rip up rule indicates that the autorouter cannot rip up and reroute a routed net. You can set this option in the **Routing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box. You cannot unroute objects that have a no rip up rule. If you try to unroute them, an error message appears. You can click on the text link to zoom to the trace or via location. Use the object's Properties dialog box to enable rip up. For more information see ""Design Rules"on page 154."
