# **Chapter 2 Interactive Routing QuickStart**

If desired, you can route all or part of your design manually rather than using the autorouter process.

Perform the following steps to get started quickly.

Alternatively, watch the SailWind Layout and SailWind Router Getting Started Videos for Netlist Projects or for all the advanced features in SailWind Router for placing and routing your design, see SailWind Router Introductory Videos for Netlist Projects.

## <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Step 1 - Open a SailWind Layout File**

SailWind Router reads and writes native SailWind Layout design files. Perform the following steps to load a SailWind Layout file.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. On the standard toolbar, click the **Open** button.
- 2. In the Files of type list, select **PCB Design Files (\*.pcb,\*.bre)**.
- 3. Click the SailWind Layout design file you want and then click **Open**. For example, open the file named *previewplaced.pcb* in the *C:\SailWind Projects\Samples* folder. The file opens in SailWind Router.
- 4. If the file you load contains traces, delete all the traces using Unroute.
	- a. Right-click in the design area and click the **Select Nets** popup menu item.
	- b. Right-click and click the **Select All** popup menu item. All nets are selected.
	- c. Right-click and click the **Unroute** popup menu item.

Alternative: Press the Delete key.

## <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Step 2 - Set Default Design Properties**

All design properties and design rules set in SailWind Layout transfer automatically to SailWind Router, although you can change them in SailWind Router. SailWind Router also has some additional unique properties.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. On the standard toolbar, click the **Properties** button.
- 2. Assign properties using the tabs in the dialog box. See [Table](#page-1-1) [3](#page-1-1).
- 3. Click **OK** to close the Properties dialog box. Access to some tabs or features may require options not available in your SailWind Router configuration.

# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Step 3 - Route Interactively**

Interactive routing allows you to choose the desired route manually. You can set the level of automatic software input during interactive routing by setting certain options and enabling certain features beforehand.

[Setting interactive routing options](#page-2-1) [Interactive routing](#page-3-1)

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**Setting interactive routing options**

Set your design options before routing interactively.

You can change the options as desired; however, the following procedure provides recommended starting settings.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the "Routing angle" area, select the angle you prefer (Orthogonal, Diagonal, or Any angle).
- 3. In the Interactive routing area, clear the "Dynamically route" check box.

**Tip** When routing interactively, one segment is added at a time. When you click the Dynamically route check box, multiple segments and corners are added as you move the pointer.

- 4. In the Plower area, select the "Turn on plower" check box. Specific software configurations have the ability to push and shove traces while interactively adding traces. This is done by turning on the plower. The plower will be used in a later step. The plower pushes and shoves traces aside to help you route.
- 5. Click the "Plow with pointer" option. This allows you to plow without having to click to engage the plower.
- 6. Click Real-time plowing. This plows immediately without having to guide the trace to an open area.
- 7. Review the other settings in the Interactive routing area and on the other tabs of the Options dialog box.

**Note:** On the **Colors** tab, ensure the "Connection" color is set to a visible color.

8. Click **OK**.

### <span id="page-3-1"></span>**Interactive routing**

SailWind Router can route your connections intelligently, responding to obstacles in the path and adjusting the route accordingly to ensure design rules are met.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Select Unroutes/Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select an unroute or pin in the workspace.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Interactive route** popup menu item.

Alternative: Press the F3 key.

4. Move the pointer and click to create each corner in the trace.

![](_page_3_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** When you select the Dynamically route check box (in the Options dialog box > **Routing**  category > **General** subcategory), you do not need to click to add corners. Corners and segments are automatically added.

5. Click on the object where you want to complete the trace when a single or double circle is visible over the completion point.

Alternative: When the pointer is near the object at which you want to complete the trace, right-click and click the **Complete** popup menu item.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Step 4 - Plow traces while routing interactively**

With the plower enabled, the interactive router clears a path for the trace you are routing while maintaining existing connections.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Select an unroute or pin, right-click and click **Interactive route**. While routing, note that if you attempt to cross another trace, or get closer than the minimum trace-to-trace clearance, the other trace shoves aside to maintain the minimum clearance.
- 2. While routing a trace, right-click and notice your plower options. Experiment with the plower options. See [Table](#page-3-2) [4.](#page-3-2)
- 3. Complete the connection. While routing, you can temporarily change plower settings to complete a trace.
