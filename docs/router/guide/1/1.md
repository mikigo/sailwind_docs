**Note:** Ensure nothing is selected in the design when you click the **Properties** button or the resulting dialog box displays properties of the selected object.

- 2. Assign properties using the tabs in the dialog box. See [Table](#page-1-1) [1](#page-1-1).
- 3. Click **OK** to close the Properties dialog box. Access to some tabs may require optional features not available in your SailWind Router configuration.

# <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Step 3 - Assign Routing Options**

All design and display options you set in SailWind Layout transfer automatically to SailWind Router. You can, however, change them in SailWind Router. Additionally, SailWind Router contains a few unique autoroute options.

### **Procedure**

- 1. On the standard toolbar, click the **Options** button.
- 2. Assign autorouting options using the tabs in the dialog box. Access to some tabs may require optional features not available in your SailWind Router configuration.

Click the **Help** button for more information about the features on each tab.

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Step 4 - Define a Strategy**

The autoroute function performs several autorouting operations serially. You can specify the operations and the order in which they are performed in SailWind Router by defining the *autorouting strategy*.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Routing** category > **Strategy** subcategory.
- 2. Select the check box in the Pass Type column for each pass that you want to include in the autorouting operation.
	- a. Select the corresponding Protect check box to preserve all routed traces after the pass is completed.
	- b. Select the corresponding Pause check box to pause autorouting immediately after the pass completes.

### <span id="page-2-1"></span>**Step 5 - Define a Routing Order**

You can define the order in which the autorouter routes all components and net objects for each pass type. This is called the routing order.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Routing** category > **Strategy** subcategory.
- 2. In the "Pass definition" area, click the row of a pass type name to select it for routing order setup.
- 3. In the "Routing order definition" area, click components or net objects from the left-hand list and click **Selected** to move them to the Routing Order list (right-hand side).
- 4. Change the order of items in the Routing Order list by selecting items and clicking the **Up** or **Down**  button.
- 5. Click **Delete** to remove an item from the list.
- 6. Click **OK**.

# <span id="page-2-2"></span>**Step 6 - Autoroute the Design**

Use the Routing toolbar to control the autorouter.

#### **Procedure**

1. On the standard toolbar, click the **Routing toolbar** button.

[Table](#page-3-1) [2](#page-3-1) describes the buttons that appear in the Routing toolbar.

#### **Table 2. Autorouter Controls**

<span id="page-3-1"></span>

| Button             | Control                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start Autorouting  | Begins the autorouting process.                                                                                                                     |
| Resume Autorouting | Continues the autorouting process after you pause it.                                                                                               |
| Pause Autorouting  | Pauses or interrupts the autoroute process. The software<br>resumes from the point where it paused when you click<br>the Resume Autorouting button. |
| Stop Autorouting   | Halts the autorouting process. The software leaves any<br>portions that have already been routed in place.                                          |

<span id="page-3-0"></span>2. Click the **Start Autorouting** button to begin autorouting the design.

### **Step 7 - Generate Reports**

After the autorouting routine completes, it generates a routing report detailing the results. A link to the report appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

### **Procedure**

- 1. If the Output window is not already open, click the **Output Window** button on the Standard toolbar.
- 2. Click the link in the **Status** tab to open the routing report. Additional reports can be generated at your request by clicking the **File > Reports** menu item and then clicking either the **Design**, **Testability**, or **Test Points** report category.
