## Setting Colors for the Design
As you work on a design, you can customize display colors to make it easier to see objects as you place them.

Use the Colors category of the Options dialog box to perform the following tasks:

- Set and change the color of objects on a per-layer or per-object type basis.
- Make objects visible or invisible in the display (also on a per-layer or per-object type basis).
- Customize the palette of color selections.
- Save your custom color scheme. You can then switch among color schemes you commonly use to work with a design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item.
- 2. In the Options dialog box, click the Colorson page 422 category.
- 3. Set the color(s) for design objects:

a. To set the color for one object, in the Color selection area, click a color tile. Then in the Layers/ Object Types table, click the color tile for the object type in the correct layer row. (Visibility of the object must be enabled first by clicking the Visible check box for the corresponding row.)

**Tip**

To change the palette of colors from which you can select, see "["Changing the Color](#page-2-0) [Palette"on page 121"](#page-2-0).

- b. To make all objects on a layer the same color, click the layer number to select the entire row, and then click the color tile in the Color selection area.
- c. To make an object the same color on all layers, click the object name to select the entire column, and then click the color tile in the Color selection area.
- d. To make an object type invisible, set its tile to the background color. You can make multiple objects invisible (for example, all objects on the same layer).
- e. To copy a color definition from one row or column and paste it to another row or column:
	- i. Select the row or column with the color definition that you want to copy and press Ctrl+C.
	- ii. Select the row or column to which you want to paste the color definition.
	- iii. Press Ctrl+V.
- 4. Click **OK.** The display reflects your color settings.

**Results**

When you save the design, SailWind Router stores the setting with design data.

You can save display color settings you commonly use as you work on a design. See [""Saving Color](#page-2-1)  [Schemes"on page 121](#page-2-1)".

## Highlighting and Unhighlighting Design Objects
You can highlight or clear the highlighting from objects in your design to distinguish them from other design objects. Highlights help you visually locate objects when working on a dense design.

You can set how highlighting is displayed using the "Distinguish highlighted objects by" list in the "Options Dialog Box, Global Category, General Subcategory" on page 441.

[Highlighting Objects](#page-4-1) [Unhighlighting Objects](#page-4-2) [Unhighlighting All Objects](#page-4-3)

### Highlighting Objects
You can highlight one or more objects in the design.

**Procedure**

Press and hold the Alt key then select one or more objects. Alternatively, select an object then click the **Edit > Highlight** menu item.

| Page Down | Zooms out centered at the pointer location.                                                                                                      |
| Ins       | Centers the view at the current pointer location, without zooming.                                                                               |

Use the vertical and horizontal scroll bars to pan the view vertically or horizontally.

**Displaying Selected Nets**

Use the View Nets dialog box (accessible from the View menu) to select and view nets. The View Nets dialog box shows View details for selected nets. For each net, you can hide or show connections, routed paths, or unrouted paths. When you move nets into the View list box, you can specify color and show or hide various unroutes.

**Viewing Nets by Color**

Use the color palette to show a selected net in a specific color. When you assign a color to a net, the pads, vias, and connections on all layers appear in the assigned color. This makes it easier to identify nets when you split planes. Any net color assignments you make are saved when you save the design.

## Pan, Zoom, and Scroll the Display
Use the mouse wheel to scroll, pan, and zoom the workspace display.

The following mouse/key combinations affect the display:

- Roll the mouse wheel to scroll the display up and down.
- Press and hold the Shift key while rolling the mouse wheel to pan left and right.
- Press and hold the CTRL key while rolling the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

## Scrolling Through Layers Using the Wheel
If desired, you can press and hold Alt and roll the mouse wheel to scroll through layers of the design. Use this feature for previewing layers while routing interactively and for displaying individual electrical layers.

[Previewing Layers While Interactively Routing](#page-7-2) [Displaying Individual Electrical Layers](#page-7-3)

### Previewing Layers While Interactively Routing
The ability to preview layers during routing and trace editing helps you determine which layer has the most space for additional traces.

**Procedure**

- 1. While interactively routing, press Alt and roll the wheel button backward or forward.
- 2. Do one of the following:
	- To transition layers at the current pointer location, press Shift and click. A via appears at the pointer location, allowing you to continue routing from that point on the layer you previewed.
	- To move the trace in progress (from the last corner location), press Ctrl and click the middle mouse button. A via appears at the last corner location and moves the trace to the layer you previewed.

### Displaying Individual Electrical Layers
You can cycle the display through the set of individual electrical layers. Switching the display to adjacent electrical layers skips over non-electrical layers and also renders all other layers invisible.

**Procedure**

- 1. Type the shortcut key Z C to make the current layer visible and make all other layers invisible. The current layer does not have to be an electrical layer.
- 2. To switch the display to an adjacent electrical layer, press Alt and roll the wheel button backward or forward. As an alternative, you can use Alt+Arrow up instead of Alt+wheel backward. You can use Alt+Arrow down instead of Alt+wheel forward. When you try to switch beyond the outermost electrical layer, the display loops back to the outermost electrical layer on the other side of the board.

## Viewing by Layer Using the Layers List
SailWind Router provides a Layers list view to allow you to display a specific layer on top of other layers.

**Note:** The board outline, unroutes, thermal indicators, and test point indicators always appear on top of other objects, regardless of layer selection.

**Procedure**

- 1. On the standard toolbar, open the Layers list.
- 2. Click the layer you want to display on top.

**Tip** If you select All Layers, layers appear from bottom to top.

## Showing Previous or Next Views
Use Previous View and Next View to display previous and next views recorded by the program. Show Previous and Show Next work like multilevel undo and redo commands. You can save up to 100 views. When the view buffer is full, newer views replace the oldest views.

**Procedure**

To show the previous view, click the **View > Show Previous** menu item. To show the next view, click the **View > Show Next** menu item.
