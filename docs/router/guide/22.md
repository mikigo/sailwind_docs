## Reporting Design Information
SailWind Router provides you with several types of reports for a given design.

SailWind Router reports are available from one of the following primary categories:

- **Design** Provides information about autorouter-related design elements, such as the number of nets, connections, traces, vias, unroutes, and the percent of routed connections in the design
- **Prerouting Analysis** Provides information about design properties that may impede autorouting, such as grid settings, nets that have a disabled routing status, or pin pairs that have a shove-protected status
- **Testability** Provides information about which nets are inaccessible and why they are inaccessible.
- **Test Points** Provides information about all test points in the design, such as the total number in the design, their location, probe nail diameter, the object and netname to which the test point is assigned.

You generate most reports from the Report commands on the **File** menu.

## The Design Report
The Design report displays information about autorouter-related design elements, such as the number of nets, connections, traces, vias, unroutes, and the percentage of routed connections in the design.

## Testability Report
The Testability Report allows you to assess the overall testability of your design and helps to locate any nets that may not have accessible test points.

The report provides test points results in two ways:

- By a number at the end of a inaccessible net, indicating the reason a test point is not added (shown in the **Status** tab of the Output window after each routing pass). To report with this number, select Generate Test Points on the **Test Points** tab of the Options dialog box.
- By a testability report. This report, *TestabilityReport.txt*, displays information about inaccessible nets. The reasons also appear so you can correct the problems. This increases the probability that your design is 100% accessible. This report is stored in *\SailWind Projects*. To view the report, click the link to the report file, *\SailWind Projects\TestabilityReport.txt*, in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

For more information, refer to "Creating a [Testability](#page-7-0) Report."

**Testability Report Format**

The Testability Report uses a pre-defined format that allows you to view and analyze the testpoint data related to your design.

## Creating a Testability Report
The Testability report provides information about the testability of a board, including which nets are accessible and which are inaccessible.

Running the Testability report creates the file *TestabilityReport.txt* in the *\SailWind projects* folder. A link to the report appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

**Procedure**

Click the **File > Reports > Testability** menu item.

**Results**

The file TestabilityReport.txt is created in the \SailWind projects folder, and a link to the report appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window. Click the link to view the report.

## The Routing Report
The Routing report displays information about the autorouting progress. SailWind Router stores the report, *RoutingReport.txt*, in *\SailWind Projects*. To view the report, click the link to the report file, *\SailWind Projects\RoutingReport.txt*, in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

The format of the routing report follows. For more information, refer to ["Creating a Routing Report"on](#page-11-0) [page 380.](#page-11-0)

**Routing Report Format**

The Routing Report uses a pre-defined format to organize data related to the routing of your design.

```
HEADER
SailWind Router Version <version>, Routing Report
Design: D:\design\demob1.pcb
SUMMARY
Number of passes: Number of passes the autorouter performed
Routed: Number of connections that were completely routed
Vias Total: Total number of vias in the design, followed by
(added) the number of vias added (+) or removed (-) in
 parentheses
Trace Length Total: Total trace Length in the design, followed by
(increased) the amount increased (+) or decreased (-) in
 parentheses
Test Points Total : Total number of test points, followed by how
(added) many were added in parentheses
Total Time: Amount of time the router spent routing
PASS DETAILS
Pass: Pass number followed by the name of the pass,
 in parentheses, as it appears on the Strategy
 tab
Pins Processed: For the fanout pass only. The number of pins
 the program attempted to fan out in the pass.
 The number includes successful and failed
 fanouts.
Fanouts Created: The number of fanouts created in the pass.
Links Selected: Number of unroutes to route in the pass. The
```

```
 number is determined by the routing order or
 by the selection.
Links Processed: Number of unroutes the program tried to route
 in the pass. Includes complete and incomplete
 routes.
 More unroutes are processed than selected
 because pins not connected by an unroute are
 considered when routing. For example, a net
 consists of three pins (A,B, and C) and two
 unroutes (A to B and A to C). The router
 considers an unroute between B and C. Therefore,
 the routing report lists two unroutes selected
 and three unroutes processed.
Routed: Number of unroutes routed in the pass.
Vias: Number of vias in the design, followed by the
 number of vias added (+) or subtracted (-)
 in the pass in parenthses
Trace Length: Total trace length, in mils. in the design,
 followed by the total length added (+) or
 subtracted (-) in the pass in parentheses
Test Points: Total number of test points in the design,
 followed by, in parentheses, by the number of
 test points added (+) or subtracted (-) in the
 pass
Accessible Nets: Total number of accessible nets in the design,
 followed, in parentheses, by the number of nets
 made accessible (+) or made inaccessible (-) in
 the pass
Time: Amount of time the router spent on this pass,
 followed by the total time spent routing in
 parentheses
```

## Creating a Routing Report
This report provides information about the autorouter progress during autorouting, such as the number of passes, connections completely routed, vias, and test points in the design.

Running the report creates the file *RoutingReport.txt* in the *\SailWind projects* folder. A link to the report appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

**Procedure**

Click the **Routing toolbar** button, then click the **Start Autorouting** button.

**Results**

SailWind Router creates the *RoutingReport.txt* file in the *\SailWind Projects* folder, and a link to the report appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window. Click the link to view the report.

## Testing Database Integrity
When a file loads, SailWind Router performs an integrity test on the database. SailWind Router bases its integrity test on the integrity test performed in SailWind Layout. Any integrity test error messages appear in the **Status** tab of the Output window. Each error links directly to the location of the error in the design. Click on the error link to zoom in on the error in the design. The **Status** tab displays up to 20 errors. All errors save to a report named *TestIntegrity.txt* located in *\SailWind Projects*. To view the report, click the link to the report file in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

**Checking Database Integrity**

You can run the same database integrity check at any time. The integrity check verifies the values within the database to be within an acceptable range. If the integrity check encounters any problems, the **Status**  tab of the Output window displays the errors.

For more information, refer to ["Creating](#page-13-0) an Integrity Test Report."

**Integrity Test Report Format**

The Integrity Test Report uses a pre-defined format to organize the information related to the database integrity of your design.

```
