# Chapter 11 Set Up Rules
Design rules allow you to exercise precise control over your routing results. A wide range of settings let you specify simple clearances between design objects or expand the rules to include complex relationships between nets, classes groups, pin pairs, and layers.

## Design Rules
Design rules allow you to assign constraints to your design objects. Assigning constraints allows you to control clearances between objects, assign vias to specific layers, control which layers will be used for

routing, set up complex relationships between objects (or groups of objects), and define numerous other design constraints.

**Hard and Soft Rules**

There are two kinds of design rules: *hard* and *soft*. A hard rule is always followed, even if the result is an uncompleted route. A soft rule is ignored when it would result in an uncompleted route.

Most rules are permanently either hard or soft; a few rules are switchable—that is, they can be changed from hard to soft and back again.

**Hard Rule Examples**

- All clearance rules
- All via biasing rules

**Soft Rule Examples**

- Fanout rules
- Routing restrictions on component layers

**Switchable Hard/Soft Rule Examples**

- Length rules— Hardness/softness is controlled by the "Ignore length rules when required to complete traces" check box in the **Tune** tab of the Options dialog box.
- Same net first corner rules— Hardness/softness is controlled by the "Ignore first corner rules to complete traces when required" check box in the **Pad Entry** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.

## Rules Hierarchy
Certain rules have priority over other rules. For example, a pin pair rule overrides a group rule, and a group rule overrides a net rule. This structure is known as the *rules hierarchy*.

Default rules, at level 1, have the lowest priority and represent the lowest level of the rules hierarchy. Electrical Net rules, at level 34, have the highest priority and represent the highest level of the rules hierarchy.

- 2. Default with conditional layer rule

## Design Rules Passed from SailWind Layout
SailWind Layout passes most of the design rules in a design to SailWind Router. Upon completion of your routing session, SailWind Router passes the rules (and any modifications made to them) seamlessly back with the design to SailWind Layout.

With the exception of high-speed rules and [rules on pin pairs of plane netson page 159,](#page-6-0) SailWind Router uses the same design rules as SailWind Layout ([Table](#page-4-1) [52\)](#page-4-1).

## SailWind Layout Design Rules vs. SailWind Router Properties
In SailWind Layout, you use Design Rules to assign constraints to your design objects. Such constraints include clearances, via assignments, layer assignments, and other complex design object relationships. SailWind Router supports most of these same rules; however, SailWind Router refers to them as *Properties*.

This table shows the location of specific Design Rules in SailWind Layout and the corresponding Properties location in SailWind Router.

## Pin Pairs and Plane Nets
SailWind Router does not allow Pin Pair rules or Pin Pair Group rules defined for Plane nets. These rules affect SailWind Router performance as they present a technically complex scenario.

If plane net pin pairs are assigned in SailWind Layout they are removed after the design is opened in SailWind Router. You cannot assign these rules in SailWind Router. In either case the following messages appear in the Output window:

- **For plane net pin pair rules**  "Pin Pair rules cannot be assigned in plane nets."
- **For plane net pin pairs in a group**  "Pin Pairs cannot be included to Group in plane nets."

For non-plane nets, the limit can be controlled in the *SailWindRouter.ini* file by the following:

```
[General]
NonPowerNetMaxPinCount=50
```
With this setting, if a net has more than 50 pins, SailWind Router considers it to be a large net and does not support pin pair rules for it.

## Same Net Rules
Same net rules specify the minimum spacing between items in a net.

Some same net rules are permanently hard; you can make others hard or soft, using the "Ignore first corner rules to complete traces when required" check box in the **Pad Entry** tab of the Design Properties dialog box. [Table](#page-7-0) [54](#page-7-0)and [Figure 16](#page-7-1) show the different rule types for items in the same net.

**Table 54. Edge-to-edge Clearance Values that Apply to Items in the Same Net**

**Figure 16. Same Net Rules**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_7_Figure_5.jpeg)

**First Corner Rules**

First corner rules determine how clearances are enforced on traces as they exit a pad or via.

There are three first corner rules:

- Pad-to-corner(for through pins and vias),
- Trace-to-corner,
- SMD-to-corner

Pad-to-corner and SMD-to-corner rules prevent corners from being added to traces that enter or exit a pad at less than the minimum corner rules. The pad-to-corner or SMD-to-corner rules also prevent the trace from getting too close to the pad after the first corner is added. Figures [Figure 17](#page-8-0)and [Figure 18](#page-8-1)  show the first corner rules in SailWind Layout and SailWind Router.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_8_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 17. First Corner Rule in SailWind Layout**

**Figure 18. First Corner Rule in SailWind Router**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_8_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Trace-to-Corner Rule**

The trace-to-corner rule is similar to the pad-to-corner rule and also serves as a trace-to-trace rule. During autorouting, SailWind Router violates this rule only to avoid an incomplete trace. You can repair such violations during Smooth or Optimize passes.

The software uses the trace-to-corner rule [\(Figure 19](#page-9-1)) for routing only; it does not check this rule during design verification.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_8_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Trace-to-Corner Rule**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

## Pad Entry Rules
Pad entry is the point at which a trace entering or exiting a pin first crosses the edge of a pad. You can define the rules for pad entry in the design properties setup.

The quality of a pad entry is measured by the angle of the pad entry. A perfect pad entry has pad angles equal to, or greater than, 90 degrees. [Figure 20](#page-9-2)shows an unsatisfactory pad entry; the lower pad entry angle is greater than 90 degrees, but the upper pad entry angle is less than 90 degrees.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_9_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Unsatisfactory Pad Entry**

Perfect pad entry is attempted on all traces entering pins and vias regardless of the pad shape. The pad entry controls let you choose pad exit types (any angle, side, or corner) and soft corner rules. For more information, see ["Hard and Soft Rules"on page 155.](#page-2-1)

SailWind Router uses different pad entries as required to complete traces [\(Figure 21\)](#page-10-5). The software achieves best results when all pad entry types, including soft first corner rules, are permitted. The software makes poor or unsatisfactory pad entries only for the sake of trace completion.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

To maintain pin pair rules, SailWind Router does not share a pad entry or exit on nets with pin pair rules.

## Topology Restrictions
Topology rules allow you to specify the net topology type and whether you want to allow multiple connections to vias and traces in your design.

Set topology rules from the **Topology** tab of the properties setup dialog box. The following restrictions apply:

- The "Allow junctions on" settings are unavailable for all topology types except Minimized.
- The "Maximum stub length" setting is unavailable for the Minimized topology type.

## Fanout Rules
Fanout rules specify the fanout type, via placement, and the multiple connection option for pins, SMDs, vias, and traces. You can give fanouts unlimited length, or you can specify a maximum length. Fanout rules are soft rules, meaning SailWind Router ignores them in circumstances where following them would result in one or more uncompleted routes.

## Decal Rules
Decal rules specify routing, pad entry, same net, fanout, via biasing, and clearance rules for all components that use a particular decal.

## Error Rules
Error rules specify whether to ignore an error during verification operations.

## Clearance Rules
Clearance rules specify the minimum allowable air gap between object types in the design.

Object types supported include:

- Traces
- Vias
- Through-hole pads
- Surface mount (SMD) pads
- Copper
- Drill holes
- Text
- Board

**Other Clearance Rules**

Additional clearances rules maintain clearances between component bodies and drill holes.

[Table](#page-11-1) [55](#page-11-1)summarizes other clearance rules.

**Table 55. Other Clearance Rules Included**

The rules in [Table](#page-11-1) [55](#page-11-1)appear on the **Fabrication** tab of the Options dialog box.

## Setting Clearances
View and modify minimum spacing clearances using the **Clearance** tab of the properties setup dialog box.

If you selected an object, you are setting the clearance properties for that object. If you selected nothing, you are setting clearance properties for the entire design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Properties** menu item; then click the **Clearance** tab.
- 2. Type the clearance value in the box for the clearance to allow between the object listed in the row heading and the object listed in the column heading.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_12_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** To set the same value for an entire row or column, click on a column heading, row heading, or **All**. Type a value and click OK to apply the value.

3. Click **OK**.

## Grid Rules
SailWind Router provides you with a number of different grid types to assist you during the placement, routing, and test point stages of your design.

SailWind Router uses the following five routing grids:

- Test point
- Via
- Fanout
- Component
- Routing

SailWind Router has two additional grids, the Displayed and Copper Hatch grids, which it does not use during routing.

Set the routing grid using Snap to Grid on the **Grid** tab of the Design Properties dialog box. If you clear the Snap to Grid check box, grid settings are ignored.

The routing grid establishes the default routing grid for routing tasks other than components, test points, vias, and vias added during fanout operations ([Figure 22](#page-13-0)).

![](/router/guide/11/_page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/11/_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

A trace corner is on-grid if at least one of its coordinates is on the grid. A trace segment is on-grid if both of its end points are on the grid in the same plane. [Figure 23](#page-13-1)shows the routing grid for trace corners and trace segments.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_13_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/11/_page_13_Figure_5.jpeg)

The rule to maintain on-grid trace corners is soft. If a trace corner cannot be placed on-grid, the corner is placed off-grid to complete the trace.

**Grid Statistics Report**

You can create a grid statistics report in the Output window to report on pins, vias, and trace segments that are on or off the grids.

You must select the Snap Objects to Grid check box for the Routingon page 491grid before you create the grid statistics report. This is required to generate the Off-grid statistics in the report and to show the markers in the design on the locations of all the pins, vias, or trace segment endpoints that are off-grid according to the Hard/Soft rules. Markers disappear when the screen is redrawn.

**Figure 24. Grid Statistics Off-Grid Marker**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_13_Picture_11.jpeg)

The Grid Statistics reports are run using the following Shortcut (Modeless) commands.

- **GGS** Soft grid statistics: Trace segments are considered on-grid if one of the endpoints has one of either the X and Y coordinates on the Routing grid.
- **GGM** Medium grid statistics.

• **GGH**— Hard grid statistics: Trace segments are considered on-grid if one of the endpoints has both X and Y coordinates on the Routing grid.

**Tip** The Snap value in the report always displays "Off" when the grid is set to 00000\_00000 regardless of the Snap Objects to Grid setting.

**Sample Report**

This is a sample of a Soft grid statistics report.

|  |  | ______Total_____On grid___Off grid___Snap_____Soft_Grid  |
|--|--|----------------------------------------------------------|
|  |  | Pin___00206__ ___00030__ __00176___ __On___ _00050_00050 |
|  |  | Via___00072__ ___00000__ __00072___ __Off__ _00000_00000 |
|  |  | Trace_00587__ ___00151__ __00436___ __On___ _00050_00050 |

## Setting Grids
Use the **Grid** tab to view and modify all grid settings in your design.

Set a grid to restrict placement of the routing objects to specific increments. The following table lists objects and their grid placement.

| Object          | Is placed on this grid |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Trace corners   | Routing                |
| Vias, via pairs | Via                    |
| Test points     | Test Points            |

**Table 56. Objects and Grid Placement**

A trace segment is considered "on grid" if at least one of its coordinates (X or Y) is on the grid. You do not have to place both coordinates on the grid.

If you select the Snap Objects to Grid box for a grid, then pointer movements snap to the grid. This prevents you from placing objects between grid points. For more information, see ["Grid Rules"on](#page-12-0)  [page 165.](#page-12-0)

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the Design Properties grid by right-clicking in the workspace (with nothing selected) and choosing the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. Click the **Grid** tab. In the grid settings table, type the value in each box to which you want to set the grid line spacing.
- 3. Select the "Snap Objects to Grid" check box to enable snap. Clear the check box to disable snap.
- 4. Click **OK**.

[Design Rules](#page-1-1)

## Setting Layer Biasing Rules
Layer biasing rules specify whether SailWind Router can use a particular layer while routing.

Use the **Layer Biasing** tab to restrict layers available for nets and pin pairs to certain layers for routing. Layer biasing provides an additional level of control over routing on layers.

For example: You want to route power and ground nets only on outer layers, and force the routing of other nets on internal layers. To accomplish this, with nothing selected, enable outer layers for routing in the general design properties, but disable outer layers in the **Layer Biasing** tab. Then, in the Net Properties dialog box for the power and ground nets, enable the outer layers for routing in the **Layer Biasing** tab.

If you selected an object, you are setting layer biasing properties for that object. If you selected nothing, you are setting layer biasing properties for the entire design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then, in the properties dialog box, click the **Layer Biasing** tab.
- 2. Select the Allow Routing check box to enable routing on a layer. Clear the check box to disable it.
- 3. Click **OK**.

**Related Topics**

[Setting Design \(Global and Default\) Properties](#page-1-0)

## Setting Layer Rules
Layer rules specify routing parameters for the specified layer. Only electrical layers display.

Use the **Layers** tab to set routing parameters for a specific layer.

**Procedure**

- 1. With nothing selected in the workspace, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then, in the properties dialog box, click the **Layers** tab.
- 2. In the "Routing parameters for layers" area, select the Route check box to enable a layer for routing. Clear the check box to disable it.
- 3. Click in the Direction column for the layer and select the routing direction you want from the list.
- 4. Click in the Cost column for the layer and type a number 0 and 100 for the cost value.

The cost value specifies the level of usage for the layer during routing. A higher number specifies *less* use of the layer.

**5. Click OK.**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

The Type column, which displays the layer type, can only be changed in SailWind Layout.

**Related Topics**

[Setting Design \(Global and Default\) Properties](#page-1-0)

## Setting the Via Types to Use on Specific Layers
Via biasing rules specify whether SailWind Router can use a particular via type while routing.

Use the **Via Biasing** tab of the Properties dialog box to restrict the via types that SailWind Router uses while routing.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

• You cannot change the size of vias or add additional vias in SailWind Router. To change the size of a via or create new vias, open the design in SailWind Layout and use the Pad Stacks Properties dialog boxin SailWind Layout.

If you selected an object, you are setting via biasing properties for that object. If you selected nothing, you are setting via biasing properties for the entire design.

**Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then, in Properties dialog box, click the **Via Biasing** tab.
- 2. Select the Allow check box to enable SailWind Router to use the via for routing. Clear the check box to disable use of the via.
- 3. Click **OK**.

## Setting Object Properties
Object properties allow you to specify design rules for all of the objects in your design. You can also construct complex relationships between groups of objects to accommodate your most demanding design constraints.

**Tip**

The Changed Properties icon appears on the tab if the design properties differ from the properties of the selected object. The differing fields appear with a yellow background.

**Procedure**

1. Select an object then right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.

The properties that appear in the resulting dialog box depend on the selected object. Properties set in this way affect the selected object only and not global settings. [Table](#page-17-0) [57](#page-17-0)lists the available tabs for each object type.

## Creating Net Classes
Create net classes and assign Properties (Rules) by selecting nets in the Project Explorer and/or in the design workspace.

**Video**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_20_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Procedure**

- 1. Use one of the following methods, or a combination, to select the nets for the net class:
	- **Using the Project Explorer** Use the list of net names in the Project Explorer to select the nets.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_20_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** You might find it useful to split the Project Exploreron page 52 for tasks like this.

- i. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Nets list.
- ii. In the list of nets, select one or more nets to add to the net class. You can add more nets to the class later or delete nets from the class if needed.
- iii. Right-click and click Copy, or drag your selection from the list of nets and then right-click and click Paste, or drop them on the Net Classes list.
- **Using the Workspace** Use the pointer to select nets in your design.
	- i. In the design, select one or more nets to add to the net class. You can add more nets to the class later or delete nets from the class if needed.
	- ii. Right-click and click the **Make Class** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Net Classes list. The Net Classes list expands to reveal a new Class<n>, for example, Class1.
- 3. Rename the class if desired to make the name more significant.
	- a. Click to select the new class.
	- b. Click the text name of the selected class. The text is selected for renaming.
	- c. Rename the class and press the Enter key.
- 4. Right-click in the Project Explorer and make sure the Allow Selection setting is checked. Selecting the class in the Project Explorer also needs to simultaneously select the nets in the design area in order to open the Properties of the new class.
- 5. Place the pointer over the new class name, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 6. In the Net Class Properties dialog box, set unique properties for the class. For each tab in the dialog box, you can click the **Help** button to get details for each setting.

## Creating Pin Pair Groups
Create groups of pin pairs and assign Properties (Rules) by selecting pin pairs in the Project Explorer and/or in the design workspace.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

Plane nets cannot be added to Pin Pair Groups. For more information, see "[Pin Pairs and Plane Nets.](#page-6-0)"

**Procedure**

- 1. Use one of the following methods, or a combination, to select the pin pairs for the pin pair group:
	- **Using the Project Explorer** Use the lists of pin pairs of nets in the Project Explorer to select the pin pairs.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_21_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Tip** You might find it useful to split the Project Exploreron page 52 for tasks like this.

- i. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Nets list. You must expand an individual net to view the pin pairs of the net.
- ii. Select one or more pin pairs to add to the pin pair group. You can add more pin pairs to the group later or delete pin pairs from the group if needed.
- iii. Right-click and click the **Copy** popup menu item, or drag your selection from the lists of pin pairs and then right-click and click the **Paste** popup menu item. You can also drop them on the Pin Pair Groups list.
- **Using the Workspace** Use the pointer to select pin pairs in your design.
	- i. In the design, select one or more pin pairs to add to the pin pair group. You can add more pin pairs to the group later or delete pin pairs from the group if needed.
	- ii. Right-click and click the **Make Pin Pair Group** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Pin Pair Groups list. Pin Pair Groups expands to reveal a new Group<n>, for example, Group1.
- 3. Rename the group if desired to make the name more significant.
	- a. Click to select the new group.
	- b. Click the text name of the selected group. The text is selected for renaming.
	- c. Rename the group and press Enter.
- 4. Right-click in the Project Explorer and make sure the Allow Selection setting is checked. Selecting the group in the Project Explorer also needs to select the pin pairs in the design area in order to open the Properties of the new group.
- 5. Place the pointer over the new group name, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 6. In the Pin Pair Group Properties dialog box, set unique properties for the group. For each tab in the dialog box, you can click the **Help** button to get details for each setting.

## Conditional Rules
Conditional rules extend basic rule assignments and provide more control over complex designs. For example, you could set a conditional rule for a net, which comes into effect only if the net is adjacent to a specific net. Conditional rules have some additional restrictions, which make them different from other rules.

Conditional rule names are not user-definable. An automatic naming process is used for conditional rules. For more information, see [Table](#page-25-1) [59on page 178](#page-25-1).

You must specify a set of objects before you can create a conditional rule.

The following lists the conditional rules that you can create and describes how to create them.

- **Default clearance and trace width rules on a specific layer**  Copy or drag the specific electrical layer and paste or drop it on Conditional Rules in the Project Explorer.
- **Class clearance and trace width rules on a specific layer**  Copy or drag the net class and specific electrical layer and paste or drop them on Conditional Rules in the Project Explorer.
- **Net clearance and trace width rules on a specific layer**  Copy or drag the net and specific electrical layer and paste or drop them on Conditional Rules in the Project Explorer.

Because you cannot define names for conditional rules, automatic naming differentiates one rule from another.

As shown in [Table](#page-25-1) [59](#page-25-1), automatic names consist of the names of objects in the rule and the name of the layer for which the rule applies. Automatic names appear both in the **Object View** tab and in the captions of the Properties dialog box for the conditional rule.



| Rule                                                            | Automatic Name                   |  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--|
| Net +5V against Net GND on Layer Top                            | +5V : GND (Top)                  |  |
| All Objects against All Objects on Layer Bottom                 | All : All (Bottom)               |  |
| Net Class GROUND against Pin Pair R1.1 - U10.2 on<br>all layers | GROUND : R1.1-U10.2 (All Layers) |  |

**Table 59. Automatic Conditional Rule Naming**

**Conditional Rule Objects Modification**

You cannot modify the objects assigned to a conditional rule. You must delete conditional rules completely, and then recreate the conditional rule for the new set of objects.

## Creating Conditional Rules
Create conditional groups Properties (Rules) by selecting items in the Project Explorer and copying them to Conditional Rules.

**Procedure**

1. In the Project Explorer, select the items you need to make up the conditional rule. For specific information, see ["Conditional Rules"on page 175](#page-22-0).

Monitoring Trace Length

## Differential Pairs Rules
Differential pair rules assign length, gap parameters, and obstacle handling to selected pairs of nets, electrical nets, or pin pairs. When setting up your design rules, you can pair two nets or two pin pairs and define rules related to the pair. If desired, you can use differential pair rules to also restrict a layer change.

## Creating Differential Pairs
Create Differential Pairs of nets or pin pairs and assign Properties (Rules) by selecting nets or pin pairs in the Project Explorer and/or in the design workspace.

**Procedure**

- 1. Use one of the following methods, or a combination, to select the nets or pin pairs for the matched length pin pair group:
	- **Using the Project Explorer**  Use the nets or lists of pin pairs of nets in the Project Explorer to select the pin pairs.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_29_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Tip** You might find it useful to split the Project Exploreron page 52 for tasks like this.

- i. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Nets list. Expand an individual net to view its pin pairs.
- ii. Select either two nets or two pin pairs to add to the differential pair.
- iii. Right-click and click the **Copy** popup menu item, or drag your selection from the list of nets or lists of pin pairs and then right-click and click the **Paste** popup menu item, or drop them onto the Differential Pairs list.
- **Using the Workspace** Use the pointer to select nets or pin pairs in your design.
	- i. In the design, select two nets or two pin pairs to make up the differential pair.
	- ii. Right-click and click the **Make Differential Net** or the **Make Differential Pin Pair** popup menu item.
- 2. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Differential Pairs list. The Differential Pairs list expands to reveal a new Net<->Net or Pin Pair<->Pin Pair. For example, CLK1<->CLK2.
- 3. Right-click in the Project Explorer and make sure the Allow Selection setting is checked. Selecting a differential pair in the Project Explorer must also select the nets or pin pairs in the design area to open the properties of the differential pair.
- 4. Place the pointer over the new differential pair, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 5. In the "Differential Pair Properties Dialog Box, Pair Tab" on page 511, set unique properties for the pair. For specific instructions, see "Setting Differential Pair [Properties" on page 184](#page-31-0).

## Assigning the Same Rules to Multiple Differential Pairs
Set the Properties (rules) of multiple pin pairs at the same time.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects list and then expand the Differential Pairs list.
- 2. Right-click in the Project Explorer and make sure the Allow Selection setting is checked. Selecting differential pairs in the Project Explorer must also select the nets or pin pairs in the design area to open the properties of the differential pair.
- 3. Use Shift or Ctrl to select multiple differential pairs.
- 4. Place the pointer over one of the differential pairs, right-click and click **Properties**.
- 5. In the "Differential Pair Properties Dialog Box, Pair Tab" on page 511, set unique properties for the pair. For specific instructions, see "Setting Differential Pair [Properties" on page 184](#page-31-0).

Some existing settings may be unique to individual differential pairs. If some values appear blank, it is because the values are different between the various differential pairs. If you leave the value blank, the original unique value will be retained for each differential pair. If you overwrite the value, then all differential pairs inherit that value.

The <All Layers> is always displayed as a grayed text. However, if a specific layer appears in the list, but it displays with grayed text, it indicates that some differential pairs call out that specific layer while others do not.

A check box that is neither selected nor cleared but shows a filled blue square indicates that some differential pairs have the box checked and others do not. Leaving the check box in this filled blue state retains the unique settings on the Differential Pairs. Clearing or selecting the check box disables or assigns that state to all the selected differential pairs.

6. Click **OK**.

## Differential Pair Layer Hierarchy
You can assign differential pair width and gap values to layers and categories of layers; however, a layer may also fall into one or more categories.

For example, Layer 2 may also be a plane layer, and an outer layer. Therefore, the following hierarchy is followed to define which layer settings take priority:

- 1. All Layers
- 2. Plane Layers
- 3. Outer Layers

SailWind Router Guide 183

- 4. Inner Layers
- 5. Individual Layers

**Tip** Individual Layers has highest priority.

## Setting Differential Pair Properties
Use the **Pair** tab of the Differential Pair Properties dialog box to set the gap, trace width, length, and obstacle handling for differential pairs.

You can set different properties for differential pairs, which affects their routing, whether you are routing interactively, autorouting, or editing traces. Differential pair properties determine the gap between the traces in the controlled gap area, the minimum and maximum trace lengths and widths, and obstacle behavior in the controlled gap area.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_31_Figure_7.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/11/_page_31_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Tip**

When creating differential pairs, the following should be noted:

- SailWind Router routes differential pairs using the default trace width value from the Differential Pair Properties dialog box.
- Setting the differential pair width and gap per layer allows you to better control impedance.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select a differential pair then right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then click the **Pair** tab.
- 2. In the "Set trace width and gap for the pair by layer" area, type Width and Gap values in the <All layers> row.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_31_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Restriction:**

You cannot delete the <All layers> row.

3. To set the width and gap per layer, click **Add**, click in the Layer cell in the newly added row, and select the layer for which to set width and gap values. Then type Width and Gap values in the appropriate cells. The gap rule overrides any other rule defining a clearance between the differential pair members. Therefore, the gap is the minimal clearance and must be provided when possible.

**Note:**

If you select multiple differential pairs, and a layer setting does not belong to all of the selected pairs, the Layer box is unavailable for that layer. If you type a new value, it applies to the differential pairs that have this layer setting only.

**Tip**

Keep the following tips in mind:

- If you select multiple differential pairs that have the same layer setting, but the Width and Gap values do not match, the Width and Gap cells will appear empty. You can, however, type a new value, and the new value will be applied to all selected differential pairs when you click **OK** or **Apply**.
- You can also set the Width and Gap values using the Spreadsheet window, sorted for differential pairs. The spreadsheet will show the width and gap value set for <All layers>. If a specific layer has a unique setting, an asterisk appears next to the width or gap value.

For more information, see [Differential](#page-30-1) Pair Layer Hierarchy.

4. Type the minimum length value in the Minimum box. Type the maximum length value in the Maximum box.

**Tip** You can lengthen the differential pair by adding an accordion.

- 5. Select the "Restrict layer changes during autorouting" check box to force routing of the pair on a single layer. (This setting does not restrict layer changes when routing interactively.)
- 6. Select the "Allow pair to split around obstacles" check box to temporarily exceed the pair routing gap. This setting applies to autorouting and does not restrict splitting around obstacles when routing interactively.
- 7. Type the maximum number of obstacles to route around in the Maximum number of obstacles box.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_32_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Note:**

SailWind Router does not count obstacles in the start zone or end zone. This is the zone between the connection point and the shoulder of the differential pair.

8. Type the maximum spacing allowed between traces around obstacles in the Maximum obstacle size box. The size applies to the obstacle's longest horizontal or vertical dimension.

**Note:**

SailWind Router does not check the obstacle size in the start zone or end zone. This is the zone between the connection point and the shoulder of the differential pair.

9. Click **OK**.

Creating a New Object in a Secondary Group

## Component Rules
To provide improved control over the trace width for fine pitch parts or densely populated BGAs, you can specify trace width rules at the component level resulting in different trace width rules within the component boundary.

You can also set pad entry, fanout, clearance, via biasing, and same net rules at the component level. The pad entry and fanout rules are applied to all pins in the component.

Component clearance rules are based on pin clearances and other component-specific design rules. SailWind Router creates a boundary automatically to indicate where component rules start and stop.

SailWind Router often assigns boundaries at vias and trace vertices. The software automatically determines boundary locations when it autoroutes traces; however, when interactively routing, you can define when to start and stop using component rules.

When a component rule is in use, it applies to trace objects between the rule boundary and a component pin. If a trace passes under a component but does not connect to the component, the software does not check it against the component's clearance rules.

Rule boundaries ([Figure 26](#page-33-1)) also have an effect on trace editing (for more information, refer to ""Creating Traces Using Component Rules" on page 308").

![](/router/guide/11/_page_33_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Rule Boundaries**

Via biasing rules apply to the first and last vias connecting to the component. When routing, SailWind Router starts at one pin and follows a path to the next pin in the chain. Therefore, the software assigns a non-component rule via type to the first and last vias along the trace path. If this creates a spacing violation, then the software uses a component rule via type instead.

**Tip**

Exception: A unique situation exists where the component boundary is not calculated solely upon the design rules. For example, in SailWind Router, you exit a fine pitch BGA using a narrow trace width, but the trace does not automatically exit component rules at the edge of the component boundary. You decide when to use the Switch Rules command to exit component rules to change to a larger trace width according to the most relevant rule from the design hierarchy. In this case, you can extend the component rules far from the component and outside of the calculated area of the component boundary.

SailWind Layout does not understand these extended Component Rules and it may lose extended boundary locations. However, if you do not edit the design in SailWind Layout and you reopen it in SailWind Router, the extended boundary locations likely recalculate correctly.

Also, in SailWind Router, if you change the component rules after extending the component rules with a trace, the recalculated component boundary will correspond to the new component rules and may differ from the old boundary - creating an invisible split in the trace. When the design is opened in SailWind Layout, this location becomes a tack.

## Length Rules
Length rules specify the minimum and maximum trace length. You can specify length rules for a net, electrical net, or pin pair, and matched trace lengths for two or more nets, electrical nets, or pin pairs.

You can make length rules hard or soft by using the "Ignore length rules when required to complete traces" check box in the **Tune** tab of the Options dialog box. See [Hard and Soft Rules](#page-2-1).

You can assign length rules to nets and pin pairs at many levels of the hierarchy. This includes assigning the following:

- Net rules at the net and class rule levels
- Pin pair rules at the group and pin pair rule levels
- Net or pin pair length rules to members of a differential pair
- Length rules to electrical nets
- Matched length rules at the net, class, electrical net, group, and pin pair rule levels by grouping these objects into matched length groups
- Matched length net groups can contain mixtures of nets, electrical nets, and net classes

For more information, see ["Rules Hierarchy"on page 155](#page-2-0).

**Calculating Length**

The delta between end points of a segment is the length of a trace segment.

For example, a horizontal segment having a common Y coordinate for both end points but having a difference of one inch in the X coordinate for the end points has a trace length of one inch [\(Figure 27\)](#page-35-0).

![](/router/guide/11/_page_35_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](/router/guide/11/_page_35_Figure_2.jpeg)

SailWind Router calculates the length of a collection of trace segments, a pin pair, or a net by totaling the length of all trace segments, including the portions embedded within pads or vias [\(Figure 28\)](#page-35-1). The total trace length calculation includes trace segments that overlap pads or vias.

**Tip** Unlike SailWind Layout, SailWind Router counts overlapping trace segments in the trace length calculation.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_35_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Matched Length**

Matched length is defined as two or more nets, electrical nets, or pin pairs having equal total net lengths. Matched length is typically specified with a tolerance.

[Figure 29](#page-36-2) shows two different nets with a matched length, even though the trace pattern is slightly different.

![](/router/guide/11/_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)

## Routing Rules
Routing rules specify trace width allowances and what should happen during autorouting operations.

A SailWind Router feature automatically reduces trace width to the pad, provided the trace width is within the minimum and maximum width rules [\(Figure 30\)](#page-36-3). The routing rules for the trace must have a minimum width equal to or less than the width of the pad; otherwise SailWind Router does not use the feature and does not complete the trace.

**Figure 30. Routing With and Without Minimum Width Specification**

![](/router/guide/11/_page_36_Figure_6.jpeg)

## Working with Multiple Object Properties
You can assign or edit the design properties of multiple design objects simultaneously. Simultaneous editing reduces assignment tasks and aids in providing the same settings to multiple objects.

**Procedure**

- 1. Select two or more objects of the same type (for example, two nets or two components).
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.

**Results**

If multiple object types are selected, the No Properties dialog box appears. Multiple object type selection is not supported.

If multiple objects are selected, the dialog box controls behave differently, depending on the status of the objects selected.

For example, if you select a pin that serves as a test point, and another pin that does not (mixed selection), the state of the "Serve as test point" check box is dimmed with a check mark.

| Control Type and Status                           | State                  | Allowed actions   |
