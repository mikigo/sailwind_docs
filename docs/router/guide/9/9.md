# <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Selection Modes**

You can execute a command on a design object in two ways: Select the object and then select the command (known as *object mode*), or select the command and then select the object (known as *verb mode*).

#### **Object Mode**

In object mode, you click an object to select it before choosing a command. After selecting the object, you choose a command using one of the following methods:

- Right-click and select a command from the shortcut menu.
- Select a command in a toolbar or from a menu.

#### **Verb Mode**

In verb mode, you select the command you want to execute from a toolbar or menu, then you click one or more objects on which you want to perform the command. Verb mode automatically sets the selection filter to items that respond to the active command. For example, if you are in Move Component verb mode, the selection filter changes to allow selection of components only. After moving one component, you can move another simply by selecting it.

<span id="page-0-1"></span>Verb mode commands are also available on toolbars.

# **Selecting Objects**

SailWind Router provides you with multiple ways of selecting a design object.

You can select a design object using one of the following methods:

- Click directly on the object in the workspace.
- Click near it and use the **Cycle** button to cycle through nearby objects.
- Use the Find Dialog Boxto locate it and select it.
- Click on the object in Project Explorer. (If necessary, right-click and click the **Allow Selection**  popup menu item to enable selection of objects in the Project Explorer.)
- Use the Find Dialog Box, Spreadsheet Windowto locate it and select it.

When you select an object, all its elements are selected and highlighted. For example, when you select a component, all of its pins, copper, and text are also selected. Any previously selected objects are unselected.

If you double-click an object, it is selected and its properties dialog box appears. If you press Esc or rightclick and click Cancel, all objects are unselected.

You can set how selected objects appear on screen using the "Distinguish highlighted objects by" list in the Options dialog box > **Global** category > Generalon page 441 subcategory.

The table below summarizes the different ways to select objects.

**Table 50. Object Selection Methods**

### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Selection Status on the Status Bar**

When you select objects, the status bar shows which objects are selected.

For single selection, the following information appears:

[object type] [object name (if any)] [additional information]

For example:

Component: U1, Top

For multiple selections of the same things (for example, all nets), up to ten object names appear. For multiple selections of different things (for example, a mixture of nets and components), up to five object names appear for each type of object.

<span id="page-2-1"></span>For errors, the selected error count is listed along with the error type for the last error in the selection.

### **Extending Selections**

Pressing and holding the Shift key while clicking an object selects both the object and its associated items. Selected objects change to the color set for Selections in the **Display** tab of the Options dialog box.

[Table](#page-2-2) [51](#page-2-2) summarizes the effect of clicking an object while holding the Shift key.

- 2. Press the Tab key.

Each time you press the Tab key, another object in the area is selected. If only one object is in the area, the Tab key has no effect
