## <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Interactive Routing Workflow**

Using interactive routing, you create new traces or reroute existing traces. Traces patterns follow the path of the pointer, connecting one point to another. You can also add corners, vias, and other routing objects.

The following figure illustrates making a connection from one point to another with the pointer.

Setting Net [Topology](#page-2-1) [Protected Objects](#page-3-0) [Display Options for Interactive Routing](#page-5-0)

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**Setting Net Topology**

You can set different topology types for nets, which affects how they are routed whether you are routing interactively, autorouting, or editing traces. Topology types determine the order in which to connect pins in a net.

If you have nothing selected, the Design Properties dialog box appears, enabling you to set topology globally. If you selected a net or a net class, a specific properties dialog box appears, enabling you set topology for the selected net or nets.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

• The **Topology** tab does not appear in the Pin, Via, Electrical Net, Pin Pair Group, and Pin Pair Properties dialog boxes.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then, in the Properties dialog box, click the Topology tab on page 524.
- 2. Click the net topology type you want.
- 3. Click the types of junctions you want to allow.
- 4. In the "Maximum stub length" box, type the maximum value. A value of 0 means no stubs are allowed.
- 5. Click **OK**.

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Protected Objects**

You can protect objects while interactively routing or trace editing. When you protect objects, you cannot plow, unroute, move, reroute, or otherwise edit them. Objects you can protect include trace segments, traces, vias, and test points.

SailWind Router automatically protects reuse objects and jumpers defined in SailWind Layout. It does not, however, protect unions.

Protecting Traces and Vias While [Interactively](#page-3-1) Routing [Protecting Existing Objects](#page-3-2) [Unprotecting Existing Objects](#page-4-0)

### <span id="page-3-1"></span>**Protecting Traces and Vias While Interactively Routing**

You can protect traces and vias during interactive routing to prevent—for example—making inadvertent edits.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Before interactively routing, select the "Protect trace and vias when creating segments" check box.

As an alternative, while you are routing a trace, right-click and click the **Protect Traces and Vias** popup menu item. SailWind Router protects the current trace segment back to the last corner as well as any subsequent traces. The "Protect Traces and Vias" command only effects the current operation; it does not change the state of the check box in the **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory.

When you enable protection during interactive routing, SailWind Router protects objects as you create them. If you are not dynamically routing, SailWind Router protects trace segments when you click to add a corner. If you insert vias or test points while routing the trace, the software also protects them.

### **Tip**

Select the "Distinguish protected traces and vias" box (Options dialog box > Global category > General subcategory) to show protected traces, nets, vias, and test points differently from unprotected objects. For example, this can show protected objects as outlines instead of filled traces. The display of traces changes after you finish routing, not as traces are added.

### **Results**

<span id="page-3-2"></span>To turn off protection: Right-click and click the **Protect Traces and Vias** popup menu item again.

### **Protecting Existing Objects**

Protect traces and vias after placing them.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Select an object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Protect** popup menu item. As an alternative, on the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Protect** button.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Unprotecting Existing Objects**

You can remove the protection from ("unprotect") traces and vias that have been protected previously.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot unprotect reuse members or jumper vias.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Select an object.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Unprotect** popup menu item. Alternatively, on the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Unprotect** button.

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Display Options for Interactive Routing**

Several features control how traces and obstacles appear in SailWind Router.

[Dynamically Reconnecting](#page-5-1) [Showing](#page-5-2) Via Guides [Completion Points](#page-6-0) [Showing Clearances Around Obstacles](#page-6-1) [Showing Protected Objects](#page-6-2) [Showing Unroutes](#page-6-3) [Highlighting Nets](#page-7-0)

### <span id="page-5-1"></span>**Dynamically Reconnecting**

As you route, the unrouted portion of the trace dynamically reconnects to an end point in the net that is closest to the pointer. You can toggle the feature on and off.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. While interactively routing, right-click and click the **Dynamic Reconnect** popup menu item.
- 2. Repeating this procedure toggles the feature to the opposite state.

#### **Results**

- Differential pairs do not reconnect dynamically. However, if you route differential pairs separately, the individual trace reconnects dynamically according to net order.
- Nets with Protected and High-speed topology types reconnect dynamically to preserve the specified routing order.
- Unroutes do not reconnect dynamically to allow routing of a specific connection.

### **Related Topics**

Setting Net [Topology](#page-2-1)

### <span id="page-5-2"></span>**Showing Via Guides**

You can display a via guide at the pointer to help you place vias. When the Via grid differs from the Routing grid, a via guide appears, showing you the closest available locations for vias. In addition, if you are snapping to the via grid, a small matrix appears showing other valid grid points.

You can toggle the via guide on and off.

#### **Restrictions and Limitations**

If the via grid is set to 0, the via guide does not appear.

### **Procedure**

<span id="page-6-0"></span>Type "VG" and press the Enter key. This toggles the state of the via guides.

### **Completion Points**

Graphics that appear at the pointer change automatically to indicate completion points. When the pointer nears a valid completion point, the pointer changes to a bullseye. In addition, when the pointer is close to the completion object, an outline of the object blinks.

<span id="page-6-1"></span>You cannot turn this option on or off.

### **Showing Clearances Around Obstacles**

You can graphically view the minimum clearance around obstacles. Transparent outlines, called *guard bands*, surround obstacles to the object being routed or edited. Guard bands show the minimum distance you must maintain between objects.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Select the "Show guard bands on object" check box.

![](/router/_page_6_Picture_11.jpeg)

### <span id="page-6-2"></span>**Showing Protected Objects**

You can choose to show protected components, traces, vias, and test points differently from unprotected objects.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Select the "Distinguish protected traces and vias" check box. As an alternative, use the "I" shortcut key.

### **Results**

<span id="page-6-3"></span>If traces appear as filled objects, protected traces appear as outlines only.

### **Showing Unroutes**

You can choose to show unroutes at the default trace width.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Select the "Show unroutes at recommended width" check box. Otherwise unroutes appear as thin connection lines.
- 3. Click **OK**.

#### **Results**

- You can use the **U** shortcut key to turn unroute visibility on and off. This shortcut key does not effect visibility of selected or highlighted unroutes.
- You can hide unroutes by matching the color of "Connection" to the "Background" color using the Colors page of the Options dialog box.
- You can use the View Nets dialog box to set unroute visibility either globally across the design or individually for selected unroutes.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Design Rule Checking and Interactive Routing**

Turn on design rule checking and set it to Prevent to avoid design rule violations during interactive routing, route editing, and placement editing operations.

When you enable clearance checking set it to "Prevent," you generally cannot create a violation while moving the pointer because you cannot create or edit a routing object in a way that violates design rules. For example, if you attempt to route a trace between two pins, and the trace does not have enough clearance, the trace stops just before the clearance boundary of the pins. Clicking near the pins adds a corner at the last valid point before encountering an obstacle. Because the trace does not violate the clearance boundary, no violation occurs. However, placing vias while interactively routing can create violations. If placing a via creates a violation, the operation cancels without placing a via.

SailWind Router can also prevent violations that you might inadvertently create while editing object properties in one of the properties dialog boxes or in the spreadsheet window. For example, if you select a trace segment and change its width to a value that would not fit due to clearance violations, SailWind Router prevents the change.

### **Trace Sharing Rules**

Trace sharing rules restrict the sharing of vias and traces. When sharing is restricted, you may not be able to route more than two traces to a single via. Set trace sharing rules in the "Allow junctions on" area on the **Topology** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.

You can share SMD pins mounted on outer layers (on which routing is restricted), sharing a pin that otherwise cannot be shared. To provide access to the pin on the restricted layer, create a fanout of a short trace ending with a via. The trace connecting the SMD pin to the via becomes a subnet. A subnet joins to other portions of the net at the via without sharing the segment with any other portion of the nets. This fanout is called a *composite fanout*.

![](/router/_page_8_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Trace Width and Component Rules**

SailWind Router uses the recommended trace width when starting from a pin or via. When routing from a trace segment, trace corner, or end point, the software uses the current width of the selected trace. When this size cannot be used (due to clearances, for example), SailWind Router uses the recommended trace width instead. If the recommended trace width is still too large, SailWind Router tries to use the pad width, or finally, the minimum trace width. This occurs only when you select the "Allow trace necking at pads" check box on the **Routing** tab of the Options dialog box.

SailWind Router uses component rules during routing as well. One of the component rules specifies a trace width per component. When both component rules and trace width rules are defined, the software uses the width rule from the component rules set.

When you exit a pin of a component with unique trace width rules, the component width rule is applied.

Set the Maximum, Recommended, and Minimum trace widths on the **Routing** tab of the Design Properties, Net Properties, Pin Pair Properties, or Component Properties dialog boxes.

#### **Same Net Rules and Corners**

Same net corner rules determine how far from the edge of a pad you can place the first corner when routing a trace. These rules also represent the minimum distance between traces of the same net. You cannot add a corner too close to the edge of a component pin, via pad, or copper boundary unless you enable soft rules.

Set the same net rules on the **Same Net** tab of the Design Properties dialog box. Set whether first corner rules are hard or soft with the Ignore first corner rules to complete traces when required check box in the **Pad Entry** tab of the Design Properties or Component Properties dialog boxes.

### **Pad Entry Rules and Routing Interactively with Dynamics**

When routing interactively with dynamics, any traces exiting a pad or copper respect the pad entry rules. If the "Dynamically route" check box is cleared, traces do not automatically maintain pad entry rules.

Pad entry rules define how traces enter and exit component pads and manage the quality of the trace pattern at pad and trace junctions. SailWind Router maintains pad entry rules for all routing angles and pad orientations.

Set pad entry rules on the **Pad Entry** tab of the Properties dialog boxes for selected components.

### **Topology Rules**

When routing a net with a Protected topology type, SailWind Router disables the dynamic reconnect features to preserve net order. You can only connect the net in the order defined by the pin pairs; however, you can connect at any point in the branch. For example, you can connect to any trace or via that is attached to the targeted connection pin. If you are routing a high-speed net, you can click to reconnect to the final destination.

For more information, refer to Setting Net [Topology.](#page-2-1)

#### **Editing Traces and Same Net Clearance Rules**

Same net rules are verified after you complete an editing operation. With Same net Pad to Corner rules, only the first corner after the trace exits the pad is maintained. Same net Trace to Corner rules are not maintained.

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Interactive Routing**

The interactive routing features let you route traces manually, by either clicking and entering a trace pattern with your pointer or automatically following the path drawn by the pointer.

For information on using design rules with interactive routing, see [Design Rule Checking and Interactive](#page-8-0) [Routing](#page-8-0).

Trace [Plowing](#page-10-1) [Interactive](#page-12-0) Routing with the Trace Length Monitor [Monitoring](#page-15-0) Trace Length [Creating](#page-15-1) Traces [Ending](#page-17-0) Traces

## <span id="page-10-1"></span>**Trace Plowing**

The plower moves existing traces and vias automatically as you route new traces.

Observe the following restrictions when plowing traces:

- You cannot plow vias that are set as protected test points.
- You cannot plow reuse objects.
- When you enable the plower the router attempts to plow objects. To allow the plowing of nets, select the "Shove traces to complete connections when required" check box (**Routing** tab of the Design Properties, Pin Pair Properties, or Net Properties dialog boxes).
- To allow the plowing of protected objects, select the "Shove protected traces when required" check box (**Routing** tab of the Design Properties, Pin Pair Properties, or Net Properties dialog boxes).
- SailWind Router dose not plow arcs as arcs. Instead, it interrupts the arc and adds trace segments to allow for the trace in progress.

![](/router/_page_10_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Figure 66. Traces Before and After Plow**

If the plowed traces encounter an immovable obstacle, like a protected via, the plowed traces "hop" over the obstacle. SailWind Router maintains clearance rules when traces hop over objects.

For more information, refer to ["Interactive Routing Setup](#page-2-0)."

### **Plower Types**

The following table shows the available plower types.

#### **Table 78. Plower Types**

| Plower type       | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plow with pointer | Plows obstructions as the pointer moves towards them. This feature<br>works best when you route with dynamics.                                                                                                                              |
|                   | Plow with pointer has two modes:<br>• Real-time plowing— Plows obstacles immediately as the pointer<br>passes them.<br>• Guided plowing— Plows obstacles after you define a potential path<br>with the pointer and then reach an open area. |

| Plower type             | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plow after corner click | Plows obstructions only after you click to enter a corner. If no room<br>exists to move the obstruction, you cannot enter a corner. Visually, the<br>ending trace pattern is the same as with Plow with pointer movement.<br>Tip<br>This feature works best when you route without dynamics. |

**Table 78. Plower Types (continued)**

### <span id="page-12-0"></span>**Interactive Routing with the Trace Length Monitor**

As you route traces interactively, the routed length and estimated total length appear near the pointer. The feature for displaying routed and estimated length is called the *trace length monitor*.

#### **Figure 69. Routed Length and Estimated Total Length**

### **Routing Traces with Length Rules**

<span id="page-12-1"></span>When routing traces with length rules, the trace length monitor shows the routed length, the minimum length rule, and the maximum length rule for the net, electrical net, or pin pair. A progress indicator bar also appears as shown in [Figure 70.](#page-12-1)

#### **Figure 70. Routing Traces with Length Rules**

![](/router/_page_12_Figure_10.jpeg)

### **Calculating Length**

The trace length monitor calculates estimated length as the combined total of routed and unrouted length of the trace being routed and includes half the Discrete length value of each connected pin of components that have a Discrete length assigned.

![](/router/_page_12_Figure_13.jpeg)

#### **Routed Length**

The trace length monitor calculates routed length as the cumulative length of the trace. It includes half the Discrete length value of each connected pin of components that have a Discrete length assigned. If you start routing from the end point of a partially routed trace, the routed length includes the partially routed trace length. If the trace has branches, then the trace length monitor calculates the length from the branch point.

#### **Unrouted Length**

The trace length monitor calculates unrouted length as the distance from the end point of the current trace segment (attached to the pointer) to its destination. The unrouted length is recalculated as the unroute dynamically reconnects to connection points. The routing angle also effects this calculation.

#### **Progress Indicator**

For traces with length rules, the progress indicator displays the total *estimated* length for either the current pin pair or the entire net, depending on the "Show Estimated Length of Pin Pair" setting in the Routing/ General optionson page 450. If you select this check box, the progress indicator shows the estimated length for the current pin pair. When you clear the check box, the indicator shows the estimated length for the entire net. Keep in mind this setting can affect whether or not the estimated length on the display appears to meet or violate length rules while routing from one pad to the next. [Figure 72,](#page-13-0) for example, shows the progress indicator for the same net with the "Show Estimated Length of Pin Pair" check box both selected and cleared.

<span id="page-13-0"></span>![](/router/_page_13_Figure_8.jpeg)

![](/router/_page_13_Figure_9.jpeg)

### **Monitor Display**

As shown in the table below, the trace length monitor changes depending on what rules are set.

| Length rule                     | Information in report                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum/Maximum Length<br>Rules | Shows the current routed length, the total length, the minimum net<br>length rule, and whether it's applied at the net, electrical net, or pin pair<br>level of the rules hierarchy. |
| Matched Length Rules            | Shows the current routed length, the total length, and the matching net<br>length rule.                                                                                              |

**Table 79. Length Rules and Monitor Display**

| Length rule             | Information in report                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Differential Pair Rules | Shows the current routed length, the total estimated length, the<br>minimum length rule, the maximum length rule, the gap rule, and<br>whether it's a net, electrical net, or pin pair rule. |
| No Length Rules         | Shows the current routed length and the total estimated length                                                                                                                               |

#### **Table 79. Length Rules and Monitor Display(continued)**

**Colors Used in the Monitor**

The Navigation Windowshows only those nets, electrical nets, or matched length groups that have length rules and are affected by the current operation. The **Net Length Monitor** tab of the Spreadsheet window shows the nets, lengths, and rules in a table. The monitor, navigation window, and **Length Monitor** tab show length in different colors. A colored bar moves across the monitor. In the navigation window, the nets appear in colors. In the **Net Length Monitor** and **Electrical Net Length Monitor** tabs, lengths in the Length columns appear in different colors. Each color has a special meaning.

### **Color Means the net length is** Yellow Below the minimum limit Green Within the minimum and maximum limits Dark Green Within 10% of the minimum or maximum limits Red Over the maximum limit

#### **Table 80. Trace Length Monitor Colors**

**Trace Length Display**

You can monitor trace length in four places.

- **At the pointer**  Shows a graphic that monitors progress, routed length, estimated net or electrical net length, and any length rules. This information also appears on the status bar. The graphics that appear near the pointer change depending on whether the net, electrical net, or pin pair has length rules, rules other than the default, or if the rule is violated.
- **In the Navigation window**  Shows only those nets, electrical nets, or matched length groups that have length rules and are affected by the current operation.
- **In the Net Length Monitor tab of the Spreadsheet window**  Shows nets, lengths, rules routed length, unrouted length, estimated net length, and length rules. You can also change length rules here.
- **In the Electrical Net Length Monitor tab of the Spreadsheet window**  Shows electrical nets, lengths, rules routed length, unrouted length, estimated net length, and length rules. You can also change length rules here.

**Effects of the Tune Pass on Trace Length**

During interactive routing and rerouting operations, the trace length monitor may show a length greater than the actual final length. You may perform pad entry corrections on traces after you finish routing (depending on your routing preferences). These operations may change trace length slightly.

### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**Monitoring Trace Length**

You can monitor trace length when routing or editing traces. By monitoring trace length, you can ensure that traces meet length rules as you route. The trace length monitor at the pointer shows both the current routed trace length and the estimated total net or electrical net length.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

For differential pairs, the trace length monitor shows the length of one pair member at a time. Use the Tab key to switch between the pair members.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then in the Options dialog box, click the **Global** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. In the "Pointer settings" area, select the "Length monitor" check box.
- 3. To estimate the total length of the current pin pair (total length + unrouted length), select the "Show estimated length of pin pair" check box on the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory. Otherwise, the length monitor estimates the total length of the net or electrical net length (total net length + unrouted length).

![](/router/_page_15_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Tip** You can reset the current length value in the trace length monitor to zero by pressing Ctrl +Page Down while interactively routing.

4. Click **OK**. The estimated length appears next to the pointer when you begin actively routing a trace.

### <span id="page-15-1"></span>**Creating Traces**

Create traces by routing. Before routing, you must choose a starting point and initiate interactive routing. You can interactively route from copper polygons and net objects, such as a pins, virtual pins, vias, traces, trace segments, trace corners, T-junctions, unroutes, and end points of a trace.

For more information, see "Creating [Differential](#page-46-0) Pair Traces[" on page 335.](#page-46-0)

### **Procedure**

- 1. In the Layer list in the standard toolbar, choose the layer on which the objects to route exist. As an alternative, use the L shortcut key to select a layer. You cannot interactively route on restricted layers. Set layer restrictions on the **Layers** tab or the **Layer Biasing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.
- 2. Select the unroute to route, or the object from which to route. You cannot select a copper segment. You can select only the entire copper polygon. The routing start point is near the selection point.
- 3. Start interactive routing by right-clicking and clicking the **Interactive Route** popup menu item. Hatch outlines disappear automatically when you start interactive routing. SailWind Router also ignores stub length rules.
- 4. If in step 2 you selected a pin that belongs to more than one pin pair, you can change the pin pair that is selected for interactive routing. To select a different pin pair to route, right-click and click the **Switch Pin Pair** popup menu item.
- 5. Move the pointer in the direction you want to create a trace. For instructions to follow another shape with a trace, see ["Following Shapes"on page 311](#page-22-0).
- 6. If necessary, add the following while routing:
	- [Cornerson page 318](#page-29-1)  Required if you are routing without dynamics. Optional when you route dynamically. Corners typically change the direction of a trace.
	- [Vias on page 326](#page-37-0) To change layers while routing.
	- Test points on page To make your design testable.
	- ["Arcs"on page 321](#page-32-0) To create arc segments.
	- [Lengthon page 312](#page-23-0) To meet length rules using accordions.

As you move the pointer, guard bands may appear, indicating obstacles.

- 7. To change the trace properties such as width and layer while interactively routing, see ["Changing](#page-51-0) Trace [Properties](#page-51-0) While Routing" [on page 340](#page-51-0). The trace width may prevent you from routing between obstacles. If you selected the "Allow trace necking at pads" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory), you can automatically neck traces by clicking to add a corner. The trace width changes automatically to the minimum trace width. After you clear the obstacles, click again to return to the previous trace width.
- 8. End the trace as described in [Ending](#page-17-0) Traces.

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Ending Traces**

SailWind Router provides three ways to end a trace while interactively routing.

**Note:** Differential pairs require some specific steps. For more information, see Ending [Differential](#page-49-0) Pair [Traces](#page-49-0).

Completing a Trace [Connection](#page-17-1) [Ending](#page-18-0) the Trace With a Via or Test Point Ending the Trace Leaving it [Incomplete](#page-18-1)

### <span id="page-17-1"></span>**Completing a Trace Connection**

When the pointer is near a valid completion point, the pointer changes to a double circle. During rerouting, the pointer changes to a single circle to indicate a valid completion point.

#### **Procedure**

Click on the object where you want to complete the trace when a single or double circle is visible over the completion point. As an alternative, when the pointer is near the object at which you want to complete the trace, right-click, and click the **Complete** popup menu item.

#### **Results**

The trace completes, maintaining same net rules if possible. The trace width and length may also be adjusted. When you complete a trace, the autorouter passes may run automatically in the background; for example, if the object where you want to complete the trace is on another layer or far from the pointer. If a net has a length rule assigned, SailWind Router may add length automatically when you use the **Complete** popup menu item.

- If you encounter difficulty using Complete, you may need to switch to component rules before clicking **Complete**.
- If DRC Prevent mode is enabled and you receive an error message while trying to complete a trace, or if an operation does not complete, right-click and click the **Explain Last Error** menu item. DRC will explain the cause. Error markers appear if you have made them visible. If DRC Explain mode is enabled instead, the error is explained for you automatically and you can either accept the error (by right-clicking and clicking the **Continue with Errors** menu item) or you can reject it (by pressing the Esc key or right-clicking and clicking the **Cancel** popup menu item). For more information, see "Design Rule Checking Dialog Box"on page 405.
- If you are using DRC Prevent or Explain mode for clearance checking, you can temporarily turn off clearance checking in order to complete a trace. While interactively routing, right-click and click the **Check Clearance** popup menu item. You can then complete the trace, even if you are creating a clearance violation. With Check Clearance disabled, you can violate clearance boundaries and create clearance violations. When you click to complete an operation, error markers appear in the workspace at the location of each error and error messages appear in the spreadsheet window. You can continue with additional operations with Check Clearance disabled. To reactivate clearance checking during routing, you must right-click and click the **Check Clearance** popup menu item again.

• You can also disable or enable clearance checking during trace editing operations such as Move and Stretch. To temporarily disable clearance checking during these editing operations, right-click and click the **Ignore Clearance** popup menu item. To reactivate clearance checking during trace editing, right-click and click the **Ignore Clearance** popup menu item again. For more information, see "Edit Traces Using DRC Modes" on page 346.

Autorouting by Selection

### <span id="page-18-0"></span>**Ending the Trace With a Via or Test Point**

You have the option of ending a trace with either a via or a test point.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click, choose the **End Via Mode** popup menu item, then choose one of the following end via modes:
	- **End No Via** End without a via.
	- **End Via** End with a via of the current type, on the via grid, at the closest location to the pointer. Obstacles move to accommodate the via.
	- **End Test Point** End with a via of the current test point type, on the test point grid, at the closest location to the pointer and assign it as a test point. Obstacles move to accommodate the via.

SailWind Router uses the end via mode you choose until you choose a new mode.

2. Press the Ctrl key and click to end the trace.

### **Results**

When you end a trace, a smoothing pass runs automatically if the "Smooth traces on complete" check box is enabled in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > "General subcategory"on page 450.

If you end a trace with a via or a test point while the pointer is over a trace from the same net on another layer, the via connects to that trace. Exceptions:

- The via does not connect to the trace if via sharing is disabled for the net, and if the number of traces attached to the via is greater than two.
- The via does not connect to the trace if the trace is from a different subnet. In this case, when possible, the trace is plowed to make room for the via.

## <span id="page-18-1"></span>**Ending the Trace Leaving it Incomplete**

You can choose to end the trace to complete it later.

### **Procedure**

Right-click, and click the **End** popup menu item. The end via mode must be set to **End No Via**.

### **Results**

If you click the **End** popup menu item while the point is over a completion point, the trace is completed instead of ended.

When you end a trace, a smoothing pass will run automatically if you select the "Smooth traces on complete" check box on the Options Dialog Box, Routing Category, General Subcategory.

Edit Traces Using DRC Modes

## <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Creating Traces Using Component Rules**

If you start routing from a component, via, or trace segment with component rules, the component rules constrain the new trace. You can choose when to stop using component rules and start using trace rules for the creation of both traces and differential pairs.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

- When routing a differential pair from component pins, SailWind Router uses component rules automatically and you route the pair separately, just as if you clicked Route Separately.
- When routing a differential pair from fanout vias, SailWind Router uses trace rules and routes the pair together.
- When you route between component pins with differing component rules, you must create a small trace segment that uses trace rules between the two trace segments that use component rules.
- If you start routing from a trace segment or node that is part of a trace using component rules, the new trace uses component rules.
- If you start routing from a trace segment or node that is not using component rules, the new trace continues to use trace rules.

• If you start routing from a trace segment or node that is part of a composite rule trace, the new trace uses the composite rules.

#### **Note:**

A composite rule trace is a trace that is attached to a pin that is shared by two subnets. For example, if a trace belongs to more than one pin pair with different rules, the trace uses composite rules, which is defined as the most restrictive common setting for each pin pair (if one pin pair has a clearance value of 12 and the other has a clearance value of 20, the trace inherits a composite clearance value of 20).

• If you start routing from a via that is part of a composite fanout, the new trace uses the composite rules. If you switch rules, the trace uses trace rules for one of the subnets attached to the via.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Start interactive routing from a component pin or trace segment that has component rules. Component rules take effect automatically, and a "CR" graphic appears at the pointer to indicate component rules are active. The graphic also displays the reference designator of the component that owns the rules.
- 2. Right-click, and click the **Switch Rules** popup menu item. The "CR" graphic is removed from the pointer, and a virtual point is added where the rule sets change. Trace rules are now active.

### **Related Topics**

Ending Traces Using [Component](#page-20-0) Rules

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Ending Traces Using Component Rules**

While routing interactively, you can switch to component rules to complete a trace.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **Switch Rules** popup menu item to stop using trace rules and start using component rules. Component rules take effect automatically, and a "CR" graphic appears at the pointer to indicate component rules are active.
- 2. Complete the trace using one of the methods described in ["Ending](#page-17-0) Traces" [on page 306.](#page-17-0) SailWind Router maintains component rules from the last corner that you added to the completion point. The last added corner becomes a virtual point.

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Routing to an SMD Pin**

You can route to an SMD pin and complete the routing with the placement of a via on the SMD pin.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Set up SMD vias using the **Same net** tab of the Design Properties dialog box or the Component Properties dialog box.
- 2. While interactively routing, point to the SMD pin on another layer where you want to end the trace, press Shift and click to add a via at the SMD pin. As an alternative, while interactively routing, point to the SMD pin on another layer where you want to end the trace and double-click. The Route autorouter pass completes the trace and adds a via at the SMD. Skip step 3.
- 3. Right-click and select a completion method from the popup menu.

#### **Related Topics**

Properties Dialog Box, Same Net Tab

## <span id="page-21-1"></span>**Routing from an SMD Pin**

You can interactively route from a surface mount component pin.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Set up Vias at SMD options using the **Same net** tab of the Design Properties dialog box or the Component Properties dialog box.
- 2. Interactively route from a component pin.
- 3. Add a via. A via of the current type appears at the SMD pin. For more information, see ["Vias" on](#page-35-0)  [page 324.](#page-35-0)
- 4. Continue routing.

### <span id="page-21-2"></span>**Routing From an SMD Pin on Restricted Layers**

You cannot interactively route from a surface mount component pin on a restricted layer. However, the Fanout autorouter pass will create a fanout for you.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Set up Vias at SMD options using the **Same net** tab of the Design Properties dialog box or the Component Properties dialog box.
- 2. Select the surface mount component or pin.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Fanout** popup menu item to run the Fanout autorouter pass on the selected component or pin. SailWind Router creates fanouts from the SMD, with vias at the end of the stubs based on your fanout settings.
- 4. Interactively route from the vias.

# <span id="page-22-0"></span>**Following Shapes**

Use Follow while interactively routing to easily create traces that follow other shapes (another trace, board outline, copper, or trace keepout).

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot follow 2D Lines or objects on other layers.

### **Procedure**

- 1. While interactively routing, right-click and click the **Follow** popup menu item.
- 2. Click to select the object to follow. To ensure you select the correct object, move the pointer over the object; the object the trace will follow is highlighted.
- 3. Click to indicate where on the object you want to start the trace. While in Follow mode, you can still back up, and use arcs; however, all other Interactive Routing options are unavailable.
- 4. Move the pointer in the direction you want to place the trace.
- 5. Click to finish following the shape and continue with Interactive Routing.

### **Results**

The new trace appears along the outline of the selected shape. SailWind Router follows all clearance rules; if there is an obstacle along the way, the new trace goes around it and then back to following the shape at the first opportunity.

Pre-existing elements in the design, especially traces and vias, remain untouched; Follow mode works as if you had protected all nets are protected and disabled the Plower. When the Follows process encounters a trace or via from another net, it routes the trace around the obstacle.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Add Length to Traces**

Use an accordion to add length to a trace or differential pair so that it meets length rules for the net, electrical net, or pin pair.

For more information about setting options for routing to length constraints, see "Options Dialog Box, Routing Category, General Subcategory."

[Adding Accordions at Default Amplitude](#page-23-1) [Adding Accordions with Custom Amplitude](#page-24-0) Add [Accordions](#page-26-0) to Existing Traces

### <span id="page-23-1"></span>**Adding Accordions at Default Amplitude**

You can add length to your traces by adding accordions.

### **Procedure**

- 1. While interactively routing, right-click and click the **Add Accordion** popup menu item.
- 2. Move the pointer in the direction you want to place the accordion. You can create accordions at any angle, depending on your routing angle.

An accordion appears based on Minimum amplitude and Minimum gap settings (Options Dialog Box, Routing Category, General Subcategory). The amplitude of the accordion centers on the trace, as shown below.

#### **Figure 73. Adding an Accordion at Default Amplitude**

![](/router/_page_23_Figure_12.jpeg)

The gap of the accordion is based on the Minimum gap setting (Options dialog box > **Routing**  category > **Tune** subcategory).

You can also add an accordion that uses the default amplitude, but does not center on the trace, as shown in below. Start the accordion, click to enter the first section, and move the pointer in the direction you want to place the accordion.

#### **Figure 74. Adding a Non-centered Accordion**

![](/router/_page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)

You can combine the accordion creation methods. For example, you can add an accordion that uses the default amplitude, and in one of the subsequent sections, click to redefine the amplitude. This is useful if you encounter an immovable obstacle.

- 3. Right-click and click the **Complete Accordion** popup menu item to end the accordion and continue routing. As an alternative, double-click to end the accordion.
- 4. Protect your accordions after you add them to prevent the autorouter (or other editing operations) from removing or adjusting them.

### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Adding Accordions with Custom Amplitude**

Insert accordions and adjust the amplitude of individual sections as required. Create accordions at any angle depending on your routing angle.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. While interactively routing, right-click and click the **Add Accordion** popup menu item.
- 2. To define the amplitude, move the pointer to define the highest point of the accordion, right-click, and click the **Add Section** popup menu item.
- 3. Move the pointer to define the lowest point of the accordion, right-click, and click **Add Section**.

![](/router/_page_24_Figure_12.jpeg)

#### **Figure 75. Adding an Accordion with Custom Amplitude**

- 4. Move the pointer in the direction you want to place the accordion.
- 5. Right-click and click the **Complete Accordion** popup menu item to end the accordion and continue routing. As an alternative, double-click to end the accordion. The gap of the accordion

is based on the Minimum gap setting in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **Tune** subcategory. You cannot adjust the gap while adding accordions.

6. Protect your accordions after you add them to prevent the autorouter (or other editing operations) from removing or adjusting them.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**Add Accordions to Existing Traces**

You can add an accordion if the existing trace does not meet length requirements after completion.

When you add accordions to existing traces, you have two choices:

- You can add an accordion so that just enough length is added [to meet net length ruleson](#page-26-1) [page 315.](#page-26-1)
- You can [specify which part of the traceon page 315](#page-26-2) to convert to an accordion.

[Adding an Accordion to Meet Length Rules](#page-26-1) [Adding an Accordion in a Specified Area](#page-26-2)

### <span id="page-26-1"></span>**Adding an Accordion to Meet Length Rules**

You can add an accordion to a trace, increasing its routed length so that it meets your length rules.

### **Procedure**

1. Select the trace, trace segment, or trace path to which to add an accordion.

![](/router/_page_26_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** If you select a differential pair segment in the shoulder area, you can add an accordion to a single member of the pair. If you select a differential pair segment in the controlled gap area, you must add the accordion to both members of the pair.

2. Right-click and click the **Add Accordion** popup menu item. An accordion appears in the trace so that the net meets net length rules. SailWind Router generally adds the accordion to the middle of the selected trace or segment.

### <span id="page-26-2"></span>**Adding an Accordion in a Specified Area**

You can choose to specify which part of the trace to convert to an accordion.

### **Procedure**

- 1. In the Selection Filter toolbar, click the **Path** button to enable path selection.
- 2. Click on the trace or trace segment to specify the start of the accordion location.
- 3. Click again to specify the end of the accordion. If you specify a differential pair segment in the shoulder area, you can add an accordion to a single member of the pair. If you specify a differential pair segment in the controlled gap area, you must add the accordion to both members of the pair.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Add Accordion** popup menu item. SailWind Router adds an accordion to the selected path within the trace or trace segment.

[Monitoring](#page-15-0) Trace Length

## <span id="page-27-0"></span>**Miters**

Use miters to specify values for replacing a corner with a diagonal segment or arc.

The miter ratio value, set on the **Routing** tab of the Options dialog box, specifies the miter ratio for accordion corners. SailWind Router calculates the radius using the following formula:

```
(<trace_width> / 2) x Ratio
```
![](/router/_page_27_Picture_9.jpeg)

If "Use arcs" in the Miters area on the **Routing** tab is checked, the diagonal segment is replaced with an arc:

![](/router/_page_27_Figure_11.jpeg)

For example, if the trace width is 12 (set on the Trace Segment Properties dialog box), and you set the ratio to 1, the miter radius is 6 ((12 / 2) x 1 = 6). The miter segment length is about 8.49.

### **Accordions**

When accordions use miters, the miter segment cannot be longer than the middle segment:

| Accordion<br>Minimum amplitude<br>(times trace width): | З<br>π                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Maximum amplitude<br>(times trace width):              | 30                         |
| Minimum gap (times trace<br>to corner clearance):      |                            |
| Max hierarchy level:                                   | $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$<br>18 |
| Miter ratio: 100                                       |                            |
| Use arcs in miters                                     |                            |

If accordions use arcs instead, the middle segment may be completely removed:

| Accordion<br>Minimum amplitude<br>(times trace width): | з  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----|
| Maximum amplitude<br>(times trace width):              | 30 |
| Minimum gap (times trace<br>to corner clearance):      |    |
| Max hierarchy level:                                   | 18 |
| 100<br>Miter ratio:                                    |    |
| $\nabla$ Use arcs in miters                            |    |

### **Differential Pair Miters**

When you choose to add miters to differential pairs, SailWind Router generates miters for both parallel traces but calculates the miter size for the smaller (inside) miter segment based on the miter ratio setting.

### **Obstacles**

The Miter pass can create smaller miters if there are obstacles like pins or vias in the way.

## <span id="page-29-0"></span>**Corners**

SailWind Router places corners at the location that is closest to the pointer that meets current routing grid settings and design rules. When you select the "Snap Objects to Grid" check box for the Routing grid (on the **Grid** tab of the Design Properties dialog box), SailWind Router places corners on at least one grid coordinate.

The following figure illustrates corner placement on a grid.

![](/router/_page_29_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-29-2"></span>When you place the first corner after exiting a pad, SailWind Router maintains first corner rules [\(Figure](#page-29-2)  [77](#page-29-2)) unless you select the "Ignore first corner rules" check box on the **Pad Entry** tab of the Design Properties dialog box. This check box makes first corner rules soft.

![](/router/_page_29_Figure_6.jpeg)

[Adding Corners While Interactively Routing](#page-29-1) Adding [Corners](#page-30-0) to Existing Traces

## <span id="page-29-1"></span>**Adding Corners While Interactively Routing**

You can add corners when routing with or without dynamics.

### **Procedure**

While interactively routing a trace, click to enter a corner. As an alternative, right-click and click the **Add Corner** popup menu item. SailWind Router removes any trace loops and adds the corner. If you click the **Add Corner** popup menu item when the end point of a trace is over a completion point, the trace completes.

**Figure 76. On-grid Trace Corners**

#### **Tip** If you add a corner, and the trace encounters an immovable obstacle (for example a component pin), the last-entered trace corner moves automatically to a new position that allows the trace to pass the obstacle, as shown below. This happens only when you route without dynamics and the "Adjust trace segments around obstacles" check box is selected (Options dialog box > **Routing**  category > **General** subcategory).

![](/router/_page_30_Figure_2.jpeg)

When you dynamically route from an off-grid pad, SailWind Router adds corners at the point closest to the pointer and on the routing grid. When you route without dynamics from an off-grid pad, SailWind Router adds corners on a grid line, not at the grid intersection.

Pad entry settings are maintained when you route dynamically. Set pad entry on the **Pad Entry** tab of the Design Properties dialog box or Component Properties dialog box.

![](/router/_page_30_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 79. Routing from an Off-grid Pad**

## <span id="page-30-0"></span>**Adding Corners to Existing Traces**

You can add corners to an existing trace if you have already routed a connection.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Select a trace segment then right-click and click the **Add Corner** popup menu item. Alternatively, on the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Add Corner** button.
- 2. Move the pointer to the target location for the corner and click. A corner appears at the selection point. Grid lines also appear, indicating 45-degree angles from the end point of the trace. This makes it easier to place diagonal corners. When adding corners, SailWind Router does not smooth

adjacent segments, even if you have selected the "Smooth adjacent segments" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory).

![](/router/_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Tip** Press and hold the Shift key while moving corners to temporarily override the current angle mode.

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Arcs**

When routing interactively, you can add a free-drawn arc, or an arc of specified radius. This feature is also available when routing differential pairs. While routing a differential pair in arc mode, you cannot use the following commands: Add Via, Add Test Point, Add Accordion, Complete, Layer Toggle, Layer, Switch Rules.

[Adding a Free-drawn Arc](#page-32-1) [Adding an Arc of Specified Radius](#page-32-2)

### <span id="page-32-1"></span>**Adding a Free-drawn Arc**

Add a free-drawn arc to a single trace, a differential pair, or an individual trace of a differential pair.

### **Procedure**

1. While routing, click to locate the start point of the arc.

![](/router/_page_32_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Tip** Ensure you protect arcs after adding them, as autorouting operations and plowing in interactive routing may remove unprotected arcs. To protect arcs as you add them, select the "Protect traces and vias when creating segments" check box in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory. As an alternative, while interactively routing, right-click and click the **Protect Traces and Vias** popup menu item.

- 2. Right-click and click the **Arc > Add Arc** popup menu item.
- 3. Move the pointer to draw the arc.
- 4. Click again to end the arc.

## <span id="page-32-2"></span>**Adding an Arc of Specified Radius**

Add an arc of specified radius to a single trace, a differential pair, or an individual trace of a differential pair.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

- The end points of a fixed radius arc are restricted to those coincident with the routing angle and grid settings.
- You cannot create looping arcs. If you close the arc (make a circle), the circle is ignored and you continue to define the arc.

• The current routing angle determines the chord increment for the arc, as shown below.

![](/router/_page_33_Figure_2.jpeg)

#### **Figure 80. Interactive Routing— Adding Arcs**

### **Procedure**

1. If necessary, set the desired radius using the "RAD" modeless command. If you are jointly routing a differential pair, the radius defines the smaller (inside) arc.

![](/router/_page_33_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** Ensure you protect arcs after adding them as autorouting operations and plowing in interactive routing may remove unprotected arcs. To protect arcs as you add them, select the "Protect traces and vias when creating segments" check box in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory. Alternatively, while interactively routing, rightclick and click the **Protect Traces and Vias** popup menu item.

- 2. Click to locate the start point of the arc.
- 3. Right-click, and click the **Arc > Add Arc of Radius** popup menu item. The arc begins from the last entered corner, arc, or end point.
- 4. Move the pointer in the direction in which you want to create the arc. If you add an arc from a pad, or complete an arc at a pad, SailWind Router does not maintain pad entry and first corner rules.
- 5. Click to complete the arc and continue routing.

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Vias**

Add vias to route traces from the current layer to another layer in the design. The other layer then becomes the current layer. When you add a via, a via of the current type appears at a location that meets current via grid settings and design rules. SailWind Router plows movable obstacles to accommodate the new via.

If the DRCon page 405 mode for clearances is set to Prevent, and plowing is enabled, SailWind Router moves obstacles, creating room for the via without violating design rules.

SailWind Router uses the current via type for the trace in progress, provided the via biasing rules (set on the **Via Biasing** tab of the properties dialog boxes) allow it. If the current via type is not allowed for the trace, SailWind Router selects another valid via type. After using a new or different via, SailWind Router uses it for subsequent via additions.

When routing traces in the controlled gap area of a differential pair, SailWind Router adds vias on both traces. You cannot add vias while routing a differential pair in arc mode.

### <span id="page-35-1"></span>**Via Mode**

The via mode determines what kind of via type to use when inserting vias.

SailWind Router selects vias based on several requirements, including:

- Which vias are allowed for the net or pin pair, as determined by via biasing rules.
- Which vias are legal for the layer change, according to the layer drill settings you set in the Pad Stacks Properties dialog box in SailWind Layout.
- If multiple vias qualify, which via has the smallest pad size but is also larger than the trace width.

| Modeless<br>Command | For this mode | To limit the via type to                                             |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VA                  | Automatic     | Automatic selection from a list of all available vias                |
| VP                  | Partial       | Partial via types that meet the requirements mentioned above         |
| VT                  | Through       | Through-hole via types that meet the requirements mentioned<br>above |

#### **Table 81. Setting or Changing the Via Mode**

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>**Setting the Via Type**

When you add a via, its via type becomes the current via type and SailWind Router continues to use it when you add subsequent vias. When adding subsequent vias, if SailWind Router cannot use the current via type, or if it conflicts with the via mode, the via type is changed to "undefined" and then automatically selected based on the current via mode (VA, VT, or VP).

When adding a via, SailWind Router follows the settings on the **Via Biasing** tab of the following dialog boxes:

- Net Properties dialog box
- Pin Pair Properties dialog box
- Component Properties dialog box

### **Procedure**

- 1. While routing a trace, right-click, choose the **Via Type** popup menu item, and click a via type from the list; for example, STANDARDVIA. The list contains the current via type, followed by a list of allowable via types in the design, followed by via mode commands.
- 2. To choose a via type that is not visible in the list, click the **Choose** popup menu item. The **Choose**  options only appears on the menu if you have more than 12 available vias. The next via you add is of the new via type, if it meets via biasing rules and layer drill settings.

### **Results**

If you have selected the "Turn on plower" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General**  subcategory) and you change the via type of an existing via, SailWind Router may plow traces and other movable obstacles to make room for the new via type.

## <span id="page-36-1"></span>**Protecting Vias**

Protect traces and vias as you add them to your design. Routing operations cannot rip up or otherwise modify the vias.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item; then, in the Options dialog box, click the **Routing** category > **General** subcategory.
- 2. Select the "Protect traces and vias when creating segments" check box. You can move protected vias if you select the "Shove protected traces when required" check box in the **Routing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.

### <span id="page-37-1"></span>**Adding Vias on the Via Grid**

You can choose to add vias on a grid.

### **Procedure**

- 1. With nothing selected in the design area, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item; then in the Properties dialog box, click the **Grid** tab.
- 2. Select the "Snap Objects to Grid" check box for the Via grid.

**Tip**

If you select the "Smooth adjacent segments" check box (Options dialog box > **Routing**  category > **General** subcategory), SailWind Router smooths trace segments adjacent to the via.

### <span id="page-37-2"></span>**Using Layer Change and Add Via to Change to a Specific Layer**

Add Via automatically switches to the other routing layer (in a two-layer design) or to the other layer in the layer pair (for multiple-layer design). If you are routing on an unpaired layer, Add Via switches to the lowest numbered layer in the paired layer setting.

You can set layer pairs in the Options dialog box > **Routing** category > **General** subcategory. You can also combine a layer change operation with the Add Via command to change to a specific layer.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Before adding the via, press Alt while scrolling the wheel button on the mouse.
- 2. This allows you to scroll through layers in the design. When you reach the layer you want to change to, add a via as described in the following sections.

### <span id="page-37-0"></span>**Adding Vias While Interactively Routing**

You can add vias while you route a trace interactively.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add vias while routing a differential pair in arc mode.

### **Procedure**

While interactively routing, press the Shift key and click. As an alternative, right-click and click the **Add Via** popup menu item.

## <span id="page-38-0"></span>**Adding Vias to Existing Traces**

You can choose to add vias to a trace that you have already routed.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot add vias or test points to protected objects. You can, however, add a via to a trace corner if at least one of the segments in the corner is unprotected.

### **Procedure**

Select an existing trace, trace segment, trace corner, or T-junction, right-click and click the **Add Via** popup menu item. If adding a via to an existing trace changes a trace pattern, SailWind Router maintains first corner rules, which can result in changes to the trace pattern entering or exiting the via.

## <span id="page-38-1"></span>**Adding Stitching Vias**

You can also add vias to unroutes. Vias in unroutes are called *stitching vias*.

### **Procedure**

1. Select an unroute, right-click, and click the **Add Via** popup menu item.

![](/router/_page_38_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Tip** Protect vias from being moved or ripped up by clicking the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Routing** category > / **General** subcategory. Select the "Protect traces and vias when creating segments" check box. You can move protected vias if you select the "Shove protected traces when required" check box in the **Routing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.

2. Move the pointer to the via location, and click to place the via. A via appears connectedly directly to the net. In addition to maintaining via biasing rules, adding a via to an unroute also maintains component rules. If the components pins attached to the selected unroute have mismatched via biasing rules, the via type is ignored.

## <span id="page-39-0"></span>**Route to Coppers and Unroute Display**

Both SailWind Layout and SailWind Router support routing to a copper. In some cases, however, SailWind Layout does not see that coppers are joined, and displays unroutes. In contrast, SailWind Router does not display unroutes and it does not add routes because it sees the objects as joined. SailWind Router's behavior saves in the routed design file where it can pass back to SailWind Layout.

To display the design's unroutes again in SailWind Layout, perform a Length Minimization or modify the plane net routing in SailWind Layout.

SailWind Layout and SailWind Router exhibit this behavior in certain instances.

### **Connecting Through a Via**

You can connect to a copper from a different layer through a via. In the figure below, the trace and the copper are on different layers. SailWind Router does not show an unroute because trace and copper are considered connected. SailWind Layout, however, shows an unroute because it does not consider a connection from another layer.

**Table 82. Connecting to a Copper Through a Via From a Different Layer**

| SailWind Router does not show an unroute | SailWind Layout shows an unroute |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                                          |                                  |

### **Connecting an Open or Closed Copper**

You can connect an open copper with closed copper on the same layer in SailWind Router. In the figure below, the trace (open copper) is on the same layer as the copper (closed copper). SailWind Router does not show an unroute because open and closed coppers are considered connected. SailWind Layout, however, shows an unroute because it does not consider a connection between open and closed copper.

## <span id="page-40-0"></span>**Differential Pairs**

SailWind Router fully supports the implementation of differential pairs.

## <span id="page-40-1"></span>**Differential Pair Principles**

Differential pairs are traces that SailWind Router routes side-by-side, separated by a fixed routing gap for as much of the overall length as practical. Differential pairs typically transmit two electrical signals that are driven 180 degrees out of phase from each other. The fixed routing gap contributes to the specific and uniform impedance required by differential signaling.

SailWind Router respects differential pair objects created by SailWind Layout.

This section introduces the routing elements, characteristics, and routing steps unique to differential pair routing.

### **Differential Pair Routing Elements**

The figure below illustrates the various differential pair routing elements and how they fit together. The table contains a description of each routing element.

![](/router/_page_40_Figure_10.jpeg)

#### **Figure 81. Differential Pair Elements**

#### **Tip**

The source pins, destination pins, start zone, and end zone labels in the preceding graphic correspond to routing that starts at the left-hand set of pins and ends at the right-hand set of pins (the label positions reverse if the routing starts at the right-hand set of pins).

| Routing element     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| End zone            | The part of the differential pair between the split point and destination pins.                                                                                                                   |

A net may consist of differential pin pairs and non-differential pin pairs. The pair routing gap requirement does not apply to non-differential pin pairs.

#### **Figure 82. Nets with Differential and Non-differential Pin Pairs**

![](/router/_page_41_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Defining Differential Pair Characteristics**

Differential pairs typically route as impedance-matched traces, where each trace has the same specified impedance. The impedance is specified based on several factors and may depend on a particular IC manufacturer's recommendation or a standard imposed by the transmission medium through which the signals route; for example, LVDS and USB.

To yield differential pair routing with the desired impedance and signal propagation time, you supply the following differential pair properties to SailWind Router:

- Routing layer used to route the differential pair
- Pair routing gap
- Trace width
- Minimum and maximum trace lengths

You can use a high-speed analysis tool to calculate the set of differential pair property values that yield the desired impedance. To perform the calculations, you supply to the analysis tool the following layer stackup information for the board:

- Sequence of routing, dielectric, and plane layers
- Thickness of each layer
- The dielectric constant for each dielectric layer

In addition, you should learn the smallest edge-to-edge trace gap that the selected printed circuit board vendor can accurately produce without incurring extra cost. In theory, the smaller the gap, the higher the impedance.

#### **Suggested Differential Pair Routing Practices**

Some routing practices can produce differential pairs with incorrect impedance values, unmatched signal propagation delays, or elevated electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions. You can promote good differential pair performance by observing the following routing practices:

- Route the differential pair on one layer
- Avoid changing the trace width
- Maximize the percentage of the overall length that is routed at the pair routing gap
- Minimize shoulder lengths
- Match shoulder lengths
- Use the 45 degree routing angle
- Route differential pairs perpendicular to traces on adjacent routing layers if no plane layer separates the routing layers

### **Routing Differential Pairs**

This section outlines the routing steps that are unique to routing differential pairs.

#### **Routing From the Source Pins to the Gathering Point**

The differential pair is routed from the source pins to the gathering point in as short a distance as practical while observing the design rules. The router also attempts to keep the differential pair traces together in the start zone. The gathering point can be set when the traces have sufficient clearance from source pins and other objects to be routed together at the pair routing gap.

This routing program attempts to match shoulder lengths. However the orientation of the routing relative to the source pins may produce unmatched shoulder lengths, as illustrated below.

#### **Figure 83. Differential Pair with Unmatched Shoulder Lengths**

![](/router/_page_43_Figure_2.jpeg)

To allow the differential pair traces to exit high-density components, such as BGAs, SailWind Router can route around obstacles in the start zone and reduce the trace width to the minimum trace width. The router is allowed to split the differential pair around objects in the start zone, even if you do not allow routing the differential pair around objects in the controlled gap area.

When routing the start zone interactively, you can exercise a high degree of control over the shoulder routing path by entering the route separately mode and routing the individual traces to the gathering point. At the gathering point, you can exit the route separately mode and route the traces together.

#### **Routing in the Controlled Gap Area**

Between the gathering point and split point, the differential pair traces route together at the pair routing gap and at a constant trace width. During autorouting, the traces do not split around obstacles in the controlled gap area unless you specifically allow it. When routing interactively, you can always split around obstacles in the controlled gap area.

#### **Routing from the Split Point to the Destination Pins**

The differential pair routes from the split point to the destination pins in as short a distance as practical while observing the design rules set for the pair, such as minimum length. After setting the split point, the router routes the traces separately to the destination pins.

SailWind Router can route around obstacles in the end zone, just as it can when routing from the source pins to the gathering point.

#### **Routing Around Obstacles**

During autorouting, you can allow the differential pair to split around small obstacles in the controlled gap area by selecting the "Allow pair to split around obstacles" check box on the Differential Pair Properties dialog box. When routing interactively, you can always split around obstacles in the controlled gap area.

To prevent the pair from splitting too far apart or for too long a distance, you can also specify in the dialog box the maximum obstacle size and maximum obstacle quantity properties. Obstacles in the start zone or end zone are not counted against the maximum obstacle quantity you set.

#### **Restricting Layer Changes**

You can force SailWind Router to route the controlled gap area on one layer by selecting the "Restrict layer changes during autorouting" check box on the Differential Pair Properties dialog box. When you select this property, SailWind Router attempts to route the controlled gap area without vias and prevents you from interactively inserting vias into the controlled gap area.

To route the differential pair on one layer from a set of available layers, select the specific layers on the **Layer Biasing** tab in the Net Properties dialog box. The autorouter selects a layer from the set of available layers and routes the differential pair only on the selected layer. For example if you specify a set of four available layers, the autorouter selects one of the four layers and routes the differential pair only on the selected layer.

To route the differential pair only on a specific layer when using the autorouter, select only that specific layer on the **Layer Biasing** tab in the Net Properties dialog box.

You can add fanout vias to the differential pair routing, even when you choose to restrict layer changes. This behavior allows you to connect the differential pair to high-density BGA pins at the same time you route the controlled gap area on one layer.

#### **Figure 84. Differential Pair with Fanout Vias and No Routing Vias**

![](/router/_page_44_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Adding Via Pairs**

To change layers for the differential pair, SailWind Router inserts a pair of vias using one of the patterns illustrated below. (The via pattern names are based on the orientation of the via pair axis relative to the axis of the routing as it approaches the via pair.) The patterns keep the vias in a close, symmetrical pattern, and minimize the length of the connecting stubs. The perpendicular pattern is the default pattern, offering the best symmetry.

![](/router/_page_44_Figure_6.jpeg)

Via pairs snap to the via grid when you enable this feature. The following illustration shows the via pair reaction to the via grid.

![](/router/_page_45_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### **Figure 86. Via Pair Reaction to Via Grid Setting**

To add an individual via, route the traces separately. You can resume routing the traces together after placing both vias individually if both traces use the same routing layer. Or you can place the vias and complete the routing, and then you can interactively move the vias to the preferred locations.

#### **Adding Length**

To meet the differential pair's minimum length property, insert a symmetrical differential pair accordion into the controlled gap area. The autorouter can insert an accordion that meets the required length if the required space on the board is available, or you can interactively add an accordion.

![](/router/_page_45_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### **Figure 87. Anatomy of a Differential Pair Accordion**

For more information, refer to "Creating [Differential](#page-46-0) Pair Traces" and "Ending [Differential](#page-49-0) Pair Traces."

#### **Length Matching**

If you run any autorouting operation or if you run the Tune pass type on a differential pair, the autorouter attempts to match the length of both pair members exactly. When possible, it adds length to the shorter pair member in the shoulder of the trace, without plowing or shoving obstacles.

The autorouter adds length by adding small accordions to the shorter trace. The autorouter attempts to add the accordions to the shoulder areas first. If neither shoulder area can accommodate the small accordion, the autorouter adds the accordion in the controlled gap area, as close as possible to the shoulder area.

## <span id="page-46-0"></span>**Creating Differential Pair Traces**

Create differential pair traces by routing interactively. Before routing, you need to choose a starting point for the differential pair and initiate interactive routing.

To route single traces, see ["Creating](#page-15-1) Traces" [on page 304](#page-15-1).

![](/router/_page_46_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Tip** You can add arcs while routing differential pairs.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot change the trace width while interactively routing differential pairs.

### **Procedure**

- 1. On the main toolbar, click the **Route Editing** button. On the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Interactive Route** button; then select an unroute.
- 2. Define a differential pair either in SailWind Layout or in this program. For more information, see "Creating a New Object in a Secondary Group"on page 53.
- 3. On the standard toolbar, in the Layer list, choose the layer where the objects that you want to route reside. You cannot interactively route on restricted layers. Set layer restrictions on the **Layers** tab or the **Layer Biasing** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.
- 4. With the differential pair selected, right-click and click the **Interactive Route** popup menu item. You only need to select one of the unroutes in the differential pair. The traces route jointly. SailWind Router removes hatch outlines automatically when you start interactive routing.
- 5. Move the pointer to route the traces. As you move the pointer, guard bands may appear, indicating obstacles.
- 6. To route the traces individually, right-click and click the **Route Separately** popup menu item. After routing the trace to the point you want, right-click and click the **Switch Trace** popup menu item to route the other trace. After routing the other trace to the same point, right-click and click **Route Separately** (popup menu item) again to resume routing the traces jointly. As an alternative, use the Tab key to switch between members of the differential pair.
- 7. Click to anchor the gathering point, and start routing the controlled gap area. You have reached a valid gathering point when the traces route together at the pair routing gap and—if enabled—guard bands highlight any obstructions.
- 8. If necessary, add the following while routing the controlled gap zone:
	- [Cornerson page 318](#page-29-1)  Needed if you are routing without dynamics. Optional if routing with dynamics. Corners change the direction of a trace.
	- ["Arcs"on page 321](#page-32-0) To create arc segments.
- [Splitson page 340](#page-51-1) Allow the traces to pass around both sides of an obstacle by temporarily exceeding the pair routing gap.
- Via [pairs on page 336—](#page-47-0) To change layers while routing. To change via pair orientation, rightclick, choose the **Via Pattern** popup menu item, and click the new via pattern.
- Test points on page To make your design testable.
- [Length on page 312](#page-23-0) To meet length rules.
- 9. To change layers while routing, right-click, choose the **Layer** popup menu item, and click the layer on which you want to continue routing. To select a layer that is not listed, click the **Choose** popup menu item. The trace segment, from the last corner, moves to the new layer. Alternatively, use Layer Toggle to switch to the other layer in the layer pair automatically. You can also scroll through layers using the wheel button on your mouse.

For more information, see "Scrolling Through Layers Using the Wheel"on page 126.

If necessary, SailWind Router adds vias (of the current via type) or automatically removes them when you change layers. It does not remove vias that are also test points.

- 10. To change the routing angle while routing, right-click, choose the **Routing Angle** popup menu item, and click the new angle.
- 11. End the trace as described in "Ending [Differential](#page-49-0) Pair Traces" [on page 338](#page-49-0).

### <span id="page-49-0"></span>**Ending Differential Pair Traces**

You can end differential pair traces in one of three ways while routing interactively.

Completing Diff Pair Trace [Connections](#page-49-1) [Ending](#page-50-0) the Diff Pair Traces With a Via Pair or Test Point Pair Ending the Diff Pair Traces Leaving Them [Incomplete](#page-50-1)

### <span id="page-49-1"></span>**Completing Diff Pair Trace Connections**

SailWind Router offers specialized commands for completing differential pair traces.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot use the Complete command to complete traces while routing a differential pair in arc mode.

### **Procedure**

1. When you near the completion point, right-click and click the **Route Separately** popup menu item to route an individual trace to the destination pin. When you are using Route Separately, the pointer changes to a double circle when the pointer is near a valid completion point. During rerouting, the pointer changes to a single circle to indicate a valid completion point.

Alternatively, when the pointer is near the object at which you want to complete the trace, rightclick and click the **Complete** menu item, or double-click.

- 2. Click on the object where you want to complete the trace.
- 3. To route the other trace first, right-click and click the **Switch Trace** popup menu item. As an alternative, use the Tab shortcut key to switch traces. When the first differential pair trace is completed, the other trace is automatically selected for completion.

### **Results**

If you have enabled Design Rule Checking (DRC) Prevent mode and you receive an error message while trying to complete a trace, or if an operation does not complete, right-click and click the **Explain Last Error** popup menu item. The DRC explains the cause. Error markers appear if you have made them visible. If you have enabled DRC Explain mode instead, the DRC explains the error automatically and you can either accept the error (right-click and click the **Continue with Errors** popup menu item) or you can reject it (press the Esc key or right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item).

If you are using DRC Prevent or Explain mode for clearance checking, you can temporarily turn off clearance checking in order to complete a trace. To do so, while routing, right-click and click the **Check Clearance** popup menu item. You can then complete the trace, even if you are creating a clearance violation. With clearance checking disabled, you can violate clearance boundaries and create clearance violations. When you click to complete an operation, error markers appear in the workspace at the location of each error, and error messages appear in the spreadsheet window. You can continue with additional operations with clearance checking disabled. To reactivate clearance checking during routing, right-click and click the **Check Clearance** popup menu item.

#### **Restriction:**

You can only use DRC with interactive routing, trace editing, and placement editing operations.

### <span id="page-50-0"></span>**Ending the Diff Pair Traces With a Via Pair or Test Point Pair**

You can choose to end traces with a via pair or test point pair.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot end any trace with a via or test point if the current trace segment is an arc. If you end a trace while in an arc, the trace ends with no via or test point, regardless of the End Via mode setting.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click, choose the **End Via Mode** popup menu item, and click one of the following end via modes:
	- **End No Via** End without a via pair.
	- **End Via** End with a via pair of the current type, on the via grid, at the closest location to the pointer. Obstacles move to accommodate the via pair.
	- **End Test Point** End with a via pair of the current test point type, on the test point grid, at the closest location to the pointer; however, the via pair is also a test point. Obstacles move to accommodate the via pair.

SailWind Router uses the end via mode you choose until you choose a new mode.

2. Press Ctrl+click to end the trace with a via or test point, or right-click and click the **End** popup menu item.

### <span id="page-50-1"></span>**Ending the Diff Pair Traces Leaving Them Incomplete**

You can choose to end the traces at an intermediate location and finish routing them later.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Right-click and click the **End** popup menu item. Unless you are ending from an arc, you must set the end via mode to End No Via. (When ending from an arc, traces automatically end with no vias or test points.)
- 2. If you click **End** (popup menu item) while the point is over a completion point, the traces completed instead of end.
- 3. When you end the traces, a smoothing pass runs automatically if you select the Smooth traces on complete box on the Options Dialog Box, Routing Category, General Subcategory.

### <span id="page-51-1"></span>**Splitting Differential Pair Traces**

When routing a differential pair in the controlled gap area, you can split the traces to route them around an obstacle. You might split differential pair traces when you cannot route both traces together around an obstacle. SailWind Router always enables splitting in the start zone and end zone.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

Differential pairs can split around only small obstructions, such as through vias and through pins.

### **Procedure**

- 1. While routing interactively, right-click and click the **Split Trace Segments** popup menu item.
- 2. The next click completes the split operation, allowing you to continue interactively routing the differential pair.

## <span id="page-51-0"></span>**Changing Trace Properties While Routing**

If necessary, you can change trace properties while interactively routing.

#### **Procedure**

1. To change layers while routing, right-click, choose the **Layer** popup menu item, and select the layer on which to continue routing. The trace segment, from the last corner or from the beginning of the trace, moves to the new layer.

To choose a layer that is not listed, click the **Choose** popup menu item.

Alternatively, right-click and click the **Layer Toggle** popup menu item to switch to the other layer in the layer pair. You can also scroll through layers using Alt+wheel button.

For more information, see "Scrolling Through Layers Using the Wheel"on page 126.

If necessary, the software adds or removes vias (of the current via type) automatically when you change layers. The software does not remove vias if they are also test points.

2. To change the width of the traces while routing, right-click, choose the **Width** popup menu item, and click a width. To enter a width that is not listed, click **Set** (popup menu item).

For more information, see "Change Trace Width" on page 353.

- 3. To change the routing angle while routing, right-click, choose the **Routing Angle** popup menu item, and click the desired angle.
- 4. To change between dynamic routing and manual routing, right-click and click the **Dynamically Route** popup menu item. A check mark next to this option indicates it is enabled.
- 5. To temporarily change plower settings to complete a trace, right-click and choose one of the following:
	- **Push Trace Behind** Allows the plower to push traces behind the pointer as you interactively route.
	- **No Plowing**  Turns off plowing for the trace in progress.
	- **Plow After Click**  Reroutes obstacles after you add a corner or via. If you select Plow After Click, it only plows after you enter a corner or a via.
	- **Plow with Pointer**  Reroutes obstacles as you move the pointer. As an alternative, press and hold the Alt key while routing to temporarily switch between real-time plowing and guided plowing with the pointer. When using guided plowing, the potential path appears in green, but turns to yellow if the path encounters immovable objects. If your current trace colors are green or yellow, SailWind Router uses white and red instead.
	- **Rip Up Obstructing Traces** Unroutes obstacles.
