# Chapter 26 Customizing the Interface
You can customize the SailWind Router interface to suit your work style and needs. You can specify which toolbars to display, add items to toolbars and menus, and create custom toolbars, menus and shortcut keys.

You make customizations using the Customize dialog box. You can invoke the dialog box in two ways:

- From the SailWind interface, choose the **Tools > Customize** menu item. All customizations you make apply to the main view of the SailWind tool.
- In a window of the interface (for example, the Output Window), right-click and select **Customize**. Your customizations apply only to that window.

Your customizations save with your current workspace so that all of the changes you make to toolbars, menus, and shortcut keys are present when you work in that workspace again.

- 2. In the Toolbars list, select the toolbar.
- 3. Click **Reset**.

![](/router/guide/26/_page_2_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Tip** To reset all system toolbars to defaults, click **Reset All**.

### Customizing a Shortcut Menu
You can customize an existing shortcut menu by adding, deleting, or rearranging its menu items. You can also reset a shortcut menu to its default state.

![](/router/guide/26/_page_3_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Note:**

You cannot create a new shortcut menu.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Customize** menu item; then, in the Customize dialog box, click the **Toolbars and Menus** tab.
- 2. In the Shortcut Menus area, select the shortcut menu you want to modify. The shortcut menu (called Popup Menu) appears.
- 3. You can now add, delete or rearrange its menu items (commands).
	- **To add an item**:
		- i. Click the **Commands** tab of the Customize dialog box.
		- ii. In the Categories area, select a menu or toolbar name to display commands specific to that menu or toolbar. Or click All Commands.
		- iii. Drag the command to the shortcut menu.

	- **To rearrange items**: Select an item and drag it to a new location on the menu.
- 4. When you have finished customizing the menu, close it (click X) or click **Close**.

**Tip**

If a command's operation does not match the context of the shortcut menu, the Customize operation lets you add the command to the menu, but the menu does not display the command (menu item). For example, in SailWind Router, the "Smooth in router" command is a verb mode command. If you add the "Smooth in router" command to the Interactive Routing shortcut menu, the command does not appear on the menu.

### Resetting a Shortcut Menu
If you customize shortcut menus and want to change them back to their original menu items, you can reset one or all of them to default settings.

**Procedure**

- 1. Choose the **Tools > Customize** menu item and click the **Toolbars and Menus** tab.

## Organizing Windows
You can customize the way windows appear in your workspace.

[Showing and Hiding Windows](#page-20-1) [Hiding Windows Automatically](#page-20-2) [Detaching](#page-21-0) Windows from the Current View [Attaching](#page-22-0) Windows to the Current View

### Showing and Hiding Windows
Several windows display when you start SailWind Router for the first time. You can show and hide any of these windows.

![](/router/guide/26/_page_20_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** You can also hide windows automatically. See ["Hiding Windows Automatically"on page 567.](#page-20-2)

**Procedure**

To hide a visible window, click on its toggle switch on the **View** menu, or on the **Hide** command from the Window Position menu on the window's title bar. To show a hidden window, click on its toggle switch on the **View** menu.

### Hiding Windows Automatically
You can set a window to hide automatically so that it appears only when you hover the pointer over the hidden window's tab.

**Procedure**

- 1. Move your pointer to the right side of the title bar in the window you want to hide.
- 2. Click the thumbtack in the window's title bar.

The thumbtack picture changes to point sideways . A new bar appears on the side of the interface. The side on which the bar appears depends on the location of the window. For example, if the Project Explorer is located on the left side of the user interface, when you click the Auto Hide setting from the menu, the new bar appears on the left side of the interface.

The new bar contains a tab that has the same name as the window.

- 3. Hover over the tab in the new bar. The window reappears, extending over the application.
- 4. Move the pointer away from the window. The window minimizes to a tab.

**Tip** To turn off the Auto Hide feature, hover over the tab in the new bar so the window reappears. Then repeat steps 1-2 so that the thumbtack icon points downward again.

### Detaching Windows from the Current View
You can detach a window from the current view. This is called *floating*. A floating window does not attach to the current view; instead, it hovers, blocking the view to anything below it.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot float a window that is currently set to hide automatically. Turn off the Auto Hide feature before floating a window.

**Procedure**

Double-click the window's title bar. The window detaches and you can move it to any part of the screen.

![](/router/guide/26/_page_21_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** To undo the floating, see ["Attaching](#page-22-0) Windows to the Current View[" on page 569.](#page-22-0)

### Attaching Windows to the Current View
You can attach a window to the current view. This is called *docking*. A docked window attaches to the current view, and therefore does not block the view to anything below it. You can dock a window in its last docked location, or dock a window to a different location.

[Docking to the Last Location](#page-22-1) [Docking to a New Location](#page-22-2) [Embedding Windows within Other Windows](#page-24-0) [Managing](#page-28-0) Window Tabs

#### Docking to the Last Location
You can attach or dock a floating window to its last docked location.

**Procedure**

Double-click the window's title bar. The window reattaches to the interface.

#### Docking to a New Location
You can drag a floating window and dock it from one location to a new one.

**Procedure**

1. Using the title bar, drag the window.

When you start dragging the window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. At the edges of the user interface, arrows containing graphics appear, as shown in [Figure](#page-22-3) 113:

**Figure 113. Window Dragging Graphic**

![](/router/guide/26/_page_22_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip**

A similar group of arrows appears in a group near the center of the screen. Ignore that group of arrows for this procedure.

2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows on the edge of the user interface. For example, hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface.

A transparent colored block appears along the side of the user interface to which you are pointing. This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse button. For example, if you hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface, a block appears along the left side of the screen, as shown in [Figure](#page-23-0) 114.

3. Release the mouse button while hovering over the arrow that indicates where you want to dock the window.

The window docks to the user interface, and the other windows in the user interface resize.

#### Embedding Windows within Other Windows
In addition to attaching a window to a side of the user interface, you can embed a window within another window so that it shares the window space or becomes a tab within the original window.

Two [Windows](#page-24-1) Sharing One Window Space Creating Tabs Within [Windows](#page-25-0)

##### Two Windows Sharing One Window Space
You can embed a window within another window's space.

**Procedure**

1. Using the title bar, drag a window into another window.

When you start dragging a window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. A group of arrows containing graphics appears in the center of the window you are dragging, as shown in [Figure](#page-24-2) 115. Depending on the window you are dragging, the group of arrows may also have a tab graphic in the center.

## Crash Detection
Crash Detection provides the capability to capture and report unexpected terminations of the software.

If crash detection is enabled, the Error Detected dialog boxon page 414 opens at a crash and allows you to save a report of the SailWind environment as well as pertinent files in a compressed Dump File. You can then submit this file to SailWind Software Customer Support. You can also attach feedback to this report, and optionally, the Basic Media Wizard (BMW) media and project files.

The Error Detected dialog box is inaccessible unless the software crashes and crash detection is enabled in the software *.ini* file.

Crash detection is controlled by the *CrashDetection* switch in the *SailWindRouter.ini* file (located in the *C: \<install\_folder>\Settings* directory); it is turned off by default.

- If no *CrashDetection* switch exists in the [General] section of the *.ini* file, or if the switch exists with a value of 0 (zero), then crash detection is turned off. No report is created of the environment at the time of the crash.
- If the *CrashDetection* switch exists in the [General] section of the *.ini* file, with a value of 1, then crashes are detected and the Crash Detection dialog box appears.
