## About Opening Files
SailWind Router can open certain file types. Opening each file type, however, has associated limitations.

### File Types
SailWind Router allows you to open SailWind Layout and PowerPCB or PowerBGA files. You can also open SailWind Router backup files.

SailWind Router supports the following file types:

- SailWind Layout 2005 (or later) .*pcb* files
- PowerPCB and PowerBGA versions 3.5 (or later) .*pcb* files
- SailWind Router backup (*.bre*) files

You cannot open a file that another user has open.

When you open a file, the software runs an integrity test to ensure the database is stable. The session log records the names and paths of the tested file and the test report as links.

**Tip**

Click the corresponding link in the sessions log if you want to reopen a file you worked on earlier in the session.

**Note:**

When you exit SailWind Router, all current settings (including the position and size of toolbars, dialog boxes, and windows) save to the Windows Registry. SailWind Router uses these saved settings the next time you run the program.

Testing Database Integrity

### Text Fonts When Opening a File
When you open a *.pcb* file in SailWind Router, any text that uses system fonts displays it with the same font, font size, and font style as in SailWind Layout.

If any text in the file uses fonts not installed on your computer, a message in the Status Window indicates that text using those fonts will be replaced by empty boxes. These boxes appear in the same size as the text they replace, so you can examine the empty boxes for clearances, even though you cannot view the actual text.

### Differential Pair Trace Width Settings When Opening a File
You can set the width and gap for differential pair traces for all layers, or per layer. (For early versions, SailWind Router set the width and gap.)

For information on setting the width and gap per layer, see ""Setting Differential Pair Properties" on page 184".

For .*pcb* files created prior to PADS2005 SPac2, SailWind Router sets a width and gap for each differential pair, as follows:

- Sets the width for all layers as the larger of the recommended widths for each member of the differential pair.
- Sets the gap assigned to the differential pair for all layers.

### Layer Count for Security When Opening a File
When you open a file, SailWind Router checks the number of layers available for routing in your design against your security limits.

The following layers are counted as layers available for routing:

- CAM plane layers with routes
- Top and bottom layers with components
- Electrical layers
- Split/mixed plane layers

If your design has more layers available for routing than those for which you are licensed, all split/mixed plane layers without routing or components are disabled for autorouting. (You can view the disabled layers in the **Layers** tab of the Design Properties dialog box.)

For example, assume your design is a six-layer board (four routing layers and two split/mixed layers without routing or components), and you have a four-layer license. When SailWind Router reads this design, it disables the split/mixed plane layers that have no routing or components. (Split/mixed plane layers with routing or components are not disabled.) The resulting layers available for routing count of four is within your security limits (a four-layer license), and the design can be routed.

To enable a disabled layer, you must obtain a higher layer count option in your license file. For floating security, you may be able to check out a higher limit. For node-locked licensing, you may need to purchase a new configuration. In either case, you must restart the program for the new settings to take effect.

### T-Junctions When Opening a File
When you open a SailWind Layout design in SailWind Router and the design violates the no trace sharing rule, SailWind Router disconnects the affecting trace, depending on the structure of the route pattern.

If no more than two pin pairs share the segments, SailWind Router establishes a rule boundary automatically to make the design comply with the program's rules. ["Rule boundaries"on page 42](#page-3-1) improve the management of these conflicts and eliminate the requirement to disconnect traces when opening a file.

### Subnet Conflicts When Opening a File
When you open a design and this design has subnet overlaps, the nets with subnet conflicts convert to structures the program can manage. Subnet conflicts occur when a trace or via belongs to several subnets.

SailWind Router adds rule boundaries to avoid unrouting portions of a trace when pin pairs of a net share a single trace segment.

![](/router/guide/4/_page_3_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Rule Boundaries When Pin Pairs Share a Trace Segment**

When pin pairs of the same net share two trace segments that converge at one point, the software creates two overlapping rule boundaries. Because the software cannot resolve this type of conflict, it disconnects some traces.

[Figure 2](#page-4-2)shows how the software disconnects such traces.

## Opening a File
You can open SailWind Layout *.pcb* design files and SailWind Router .*bre* backup files.

When you open a file:

- Design Rule Checking (DRC) is enabled, regardless of the setting in SailWind Layout.
- In-line trace corners are removed.

For more detailed information about opening files, and about processes that occur during opening, see [""About Opening Files"on page 40](#page-1-0)."

**Restrictions and Limitations**

SailWind Router does not open *.bre* files saved using a different SailWind Router version.

**Procedure**

On the standard toolbar, click the **File > Open** menu item or click the **Open** button on the main toolbar.

**Results**

If SailWind Router discovers incompatibilities when importing an ASCII file created in a version prior to PADS 9.2, it displays a warning prompt and writes the incompatibilities to the ascii.err file.

## Scheduling File Backups
You can schedule backups to occur automatically while a design is open for editing.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > Options** menu item > **Global** category > **Backups** subcategory.
- 2. In the Options Dialog Box, Global Category, Backups Subcategory, in the Interval box, type the time in minutes between backups.
- 3. In the Number of Backups box, type the maximum number of backups you want to keep.

When the number of backups reaches this limit, the oldest existing backup is deleted whenever a new backup is created.

![](/router/guide/4/_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** This limit can specify the maximum number of backups for all designs, or the number of backups for each design. For more information, see the table "Table 88"on page 438.

4. Select the "Use design name in backup file name" check box to use "*<design name>*\_Router" instead of "Router" in the backup file name.

For example: <*design\_name*>\_Router\_<*date\_time*>.bre, instead of Router\_<*date\_time*>.bre

- 5. Select the "Create backup files in design directory" check box to place backup files in the same directory as the design.
- 6. Click **OK**.

**Results**

Backups will be saved according to settings made in this procedure, either in the design directory, or in the default Backup location specified in the "Options Dialog Box, Global Category, File Locations Subcategory"on page 439. Also, a link to the saved backup is recorded in the session log that appears in the **Status** tab of the Output window.

## Archiving Your Design
You can create a folder or a *.zip* file that contains all of your design files and supporting files for archive purposes. The folder or zip file may include the design itself, a schematic file, libraries, and any additional files or folders you want to save.

**Procedure**

- 1. Open the design you want to archive.
- 2. Click the **File > Archive** menu item.
- 3. Select the files and folders you want to archive (see "Archiver Dialog Box"on page 389).
- 4. Click **OK**.

**Results**

- If you chose to not compress the files, SailWind Router archives the selected items in the target folder you specified.
- If you chose to compress the files, SailWind Router creates a *.zip* file containing the selected items in the target folder you specified. The filename has the following format:

```
 <project_name>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.zip
```
Where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, HH is the hour (using the 24-hour clock system), MM is the minute, and SS is the second of the time you created the file.
