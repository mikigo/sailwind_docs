# **Chapter 12 Turn on Design Rule Checking**

Design Rule Checking (DRC) checks for design rule violations during interactive routing, route editing, and placement editing. When you enable DRC, SailWind Router checks your design for errors continuously, based on the defined design rules.

When you open a file in SailWind Router, it uses the existing status of DRC and not the setting from SailWind Layout. You can use the DRC Filter toolbar to enable or disable DRC for individual design rules (clearance, trace width, same net, placement, and length). The DRC Filter Toolbar reflects the settings in the Design Rule Checking dialog box.

When DRC is off, the software does not perform checks for violations, but it does not permit subnet violations. Traces between subnets may cross but they cannot join at the intersection. Layer Biasing and Via Biasing violations are not permitted when DRC is off. Autorouting always operates as though DRC is enabled and allows no errors.

## <span id="page-0-0"></span>**Setting Design Rule Checking**

You can set DRC options from the Design Rule Checking dialog box.

**Tip** If the items on the DRC toolbar are not available (and are grayed out), click the **DRC On/Off (DRC)** button on the DRC toolbar to enable the ability to select and edit the specific DRC checking options. Once you have enabled the DRC editing capability, you can use the toolbar buttons to enable and disable specific DRC checks.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Tools > DRC Settings** menu item, or click the **DRC Filter** toolbar button then click the **DRC Settings** button (on the DRC Filter toolbar).
- 2. In the Design Rule Checking dialog box, in the Enable column, select the check box for each design rule you want to check.
- 3. In the Error Response column, click the cell of the design rule for which you want to set an error response. Select the appropriate response for how you want SailWind Router to handle design rule violations when it encounters them during interactive routing, trace editing, and placement editing operations.

For more information on the DRC error response behaviors, see "Design Rule Checking Dialog Box"on page 405.

4. Click **Close**.

# **Component Spacing**

SailWind Router provides automated features to ensure adequate spacing between components.

## **Spacing Basics**

The software places components using the units of the Design grid when you enable the "snap to grid" setting.

The software prevents components from overlapping if both of the following conditions are met:

- On the **Tools > Options** menu item, **Fabrication** category, you have set up a value for "Minimum spacing between components" in the Component assembly area
- On the DRC Toolbar, you have enabled Placement DRC (design rule checking), and in the DRC Setup dialog box, you have set Placement to Prevent Errors mode

**Auto-generated Component Outlines**

The body of a component is the furthest extent of any decal object. Upon loading the design, if the system does not detect a component placement outline on Layer 20, it auto-generates an outline that encompasses all objects contained within the decal. The DRC function uses this visible outline to establish a reference component boundary.

In the preceding illustration, the "Minimum spacing between components" value applies in all cases when Placement DRC is enabled.

**Note:** SailWind Router supports separate Clearance DRC checking. If Clearance DRC checking is enabled during a Placement DRC operation, the system performs both checks simultaneously. If the TH or SMD pads of a component encounter other TH or SMD pads of another component, and the placement outlines of the components do not violate the "Minimum spacing between components" value, then the system uses the Pad to Pad, SMD to SMD, or Pad to SMD rule.

The "Minimum spacing between components" value applies to the auto-generated outline representing the furthest extent of any decal object on the following layers:

- Component layer (top or bottom)
- Associated silkscreen layer for component layer (silkscreen top or bottom)
- Layer 0 (All layers).

There is only one "Minimum spacing between components" value that must apply to all components.

#### **Advanced Spacing**

While a single "Minimum spacing between components" value may suit many of your components, you may have many parts that require extra spacing for the pick and place process, or for rework.

You can create a custom clearance outline in the decal on Layer 20. The software uses this larger outline during the placement process to create more spacing around components. The extra, larger outline is often called a component courtyard or nudge outline. The "Minimum spacing between components" value applies between Layer 20 outlines.

**Tip** In extended layers mode, Layer 20 becomes Layer 120.

### **Spacing Verification**

If you are unsure if components have been placed outside of the design rules that you have set up, run a Clearance design verification check. Be sure that all aspects of your components, including the color

for Top Plc. and Bot. Plc. objects are visible since the Clearance Placement Outline check only verifies objects that are visible and within view during its checking routine.

When setting up the Clearance check in the **Tools > Options** menu item, in the **Design Verification** category, ensure that you have selected the check box for "Placement outline" to check for the "Minimum spacing between components" value between the placement outlines.

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Checking DRC Errors During Operations**

Certain operations may be unsuccessful—such as manual routing and component placement—if they violate design rules. If you encounter an error, you can choose to suspend the operation and view the DRC errors.

**Procedure**

1. Right-click and click the **Explain Last Error** popup menu item.

Alternatively, on the Suspend toolbar, click the **Explain** button.

- 2. Click an error in the Error Type column in the Spreadsheet Window to display the DRC error message in the status bar and highlight the error location in the workspace.
- 3. Right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item to resume the command or click the **Continue with Errors** popup menu item to continue the operation despite the DRC violation.
