**Note:**

Pictures in this document are for reference only, to help users better understand the software operation. In the case of interface difference due to version changes, the interface of SailWind Router in practice shall prevail.

- **Title Bar** The application icon, document name, and application name appear in the title bar. Click the application icon to open the Windows-standard control menu, which contains commands for working with the application window. The document name changes to reflect the state of the current document. For example, when no design file is loaded "Untitled - SailWind Router" appears as the document name. When a design file is loaded, the path, the filename, and the file extension (.pcb or .bre) appear in the title bar.
- **Menu Bar**  The menu bar lists SailWind Router commands. The menus also show the appropriate command icons, access keys, and shortcuts. When a command ends with ellipses (...), additional information is needed to complete the command.
- **Standard Toolbar** The Standard toolbar contains commands that open and save designs, change the view, redraw the design, and access the toolboxes.
- **Status Bar**  The status bar contains status messages, cursor coordinates, and a system status indicator. When the system status indicator is green, the system is idle or ready for operation. When the system status indicator is red, the system cannot receive user input. The status bar also has a ToolTip that is a routing progress indicator. For more information see ""Routing Progress Indicator"on page 277."
- **Synchronization Mode Indicator**  Indicates that SailWind Layout and SailWind Router are in Synchronization mode. Also indicates which program is the active one versus the inactive one or whether the inactive program is out of sync. Enable synchronization mode from SailWind Layout to make this indicator available. See "Enabling Synchronization Mode"on page 33 for more information.
- **Line Width** Displays the current line width setting.
- **X,Y Coordinate** Displays the horizontal distance of the cursor from 0,0 as the x-coordinate and the vertical distance of the cursor from 0,0 as the y-coordinate. Also indicates the polar radius and the polar angle if you are using a polar grid.
- **Units**  Displays the current units in the design: inches, mils, millimeters, or microns. All values in dialog boxes display in these units and values you enter are interpreted in these units. For information about setting the design units, see "Options Dialog Box, Global Category, General Subcategory"on page 441.

[Project Explorer](#page-2-0) [Output Window](#page-9-0) [Navigation Window](#page-27-0) [Spreadsheet Window](#page-32-0)

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Project Explorer**

Project Explorer gives you a view of the objects in your design that is different from the view in the workspace. Instead of showing design objects in their places on the board, it lists them in a hierarchical alphabetized list. The Project Explorer view can make it easier to find and select objects.

**Tip** To allow objects selected in the Project Explorer to also highlight in the workspace, right-click in the window and click **Allow Selection**. To zoom to the item you select in Project Explorer, rightclick and click **Zoom to Selection**.

#### **Figure 4. Project Explorer**

In the Project Explorer list, an asterisk in the top left corner of an object indicates that it has rules that are not the default rules. An asterisk in the bottom right corner of an object indicates that its secondary objects contain rules that are not the default rules.

When you change your design, the hierarchical list automatically updates to reflect the changes.

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Project Explorer Objects**

Design objects in Project Explorer are organized into *primary groups* and *secondary groups*.

[Table](#page-3-1) [5](#page-3-1)shows the hierarchy of groups and objects.

### **Table 5. Hierarchy of Objects in Project Explorer(continued)**

## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Project Explorer Operations**

Use the Project Explorer to create delet rename and sort secondary group objects (rules objects).

### **Operations on Primary Groups in Netlist Projects**

All objects listed under the Layers, Components, Part Decals, Via Types, and Net Objects/Nets groups are netlist objects. Because SailWind Router is a non-ECO product and does not support netlist changes, you cannot delete, rename, move, or cut any of these objects. You can, however, copy objects from these groups to create new members of secondary groups. As an example, you cannot delete a net from the Nets group; but you can copy a net into the secondary group Net Classes to create a new net class containing this net.

### **Operations on Secondary Groups in Netlist Projects**

With the exception of the Nets group, you can create new members in all the secondary groups under Net Objects, and you can edit all members of those groups to some degree.

To create a new member of a group, copy/paste or drag and drop appropriate objects into the group. For instance, to create a new net class, drag and drop one or more nets into the Net Classes group.

### **Tip**

You can also create and name a new *empty* member of the Net Classes, Matched Length Net Groups, Pin Pair Groups, and Matched Length Pin Pair Groups using the right-click > **New**  command.

[Table](#page-4-1) [6](#page-4-1)lists the objects you can add to each of these secondary groups to create a new member of the group. [Table](#page-5-1) [7](#page-5-1)lists the operations you can perform on members of the groups.

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Splitting the Project Explorer View**

You can split the view of Project Explorer to create a second instance of the tree. Splitting the view is useful when you repeatedly copy and paste or drag and drop objects into Net Objects subtrees; for example, when you copy nets to create a Net Class.

You can split the view horizontally or vertically. The vertical split displays more of the tree and requires less scrolling, while the horizontal split allows wider views of the tree and viewing full names of design objects without scrolling left and right, and without sacrificing design space.

![](/router/_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Project Explorer Split Views**

### **Procedure**

- 1. Position the pointer in the tree area of Project Explorer.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Vertical Split** or the **Horizontal Split** popup menu item.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Sorting Objects in Project Explorer**

You can sort objects either alphabetically or by rules. Sorting by rules lists objects with rules at the top of the list.

### **Procedure**

To sort the view by rules, right-click and click the **Sort by Rules** popup menu item. To sort alphabetically again, click the **Sort by Rules** popup menu item again.

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>**Creating a New Object in a Secondary Group**

With the exception of the Nets group, you can create new members in all the secondary groups under Net Objects. You can also edit all members of those groups to some degree.

Secondary groups include net classes, pin pair groups, conditional rules, matched length net groups, matched length pin pair groups, electrical nets, and differential pairs.

The following table provides a summary of methods for creating new members of secondary object groups.

| To create this                | Perform these steps:                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**Removing an Object From a Secondary Group**

You can remove an object from Net Classes, Electrical Nets, Pin Pair Groups, Matched Length Net Groups, or Matched Length Pin Pair Groups.

You cannot remove individual objects from Differential Pairs and Conditional Rules.

### **Procedure**

Right-click the object to remove and click the **Delete** popup menu item.

### **Results**

<span id="page-8-1"></span>The objects are removed from the secondary group only; they are *not* deleted from the design.

## **Renaming Secondary Group Elements**

You can rename secondary group elements of Net Classes, Matched Length Net Groups, Matched Length Pin Pair Groups, and Pin Pair Groups.

You cannot rename an Electrical Net or Differential Pair Group.

- 1. Right-click the secondary group name, and click the **Rename** popup menu item.
- 2. Type a new name over the previous name, and press Enter.

### **Description**

The **Status** tab displays information about the current session. It specifies the filename of the opened PCB file and the name of the test integrity file that is saved. It also reports routing statistics and messages when routing a board.

If the **Status** tab is closed, and you get an error while auto-routing (or performing other tasks), the Output window opens with the **Status** tab active and the error appears in red. The Output window appears in its most recent state (floating or docked).

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>**Macro Tab**

You can edit, run, and debug macro scripts in the **Macro** tab. You can open multiple macros and nest macros using the macro editor.

A macro is any combination of commands, keystrokes, and mouse clicks that you record to replay as a single action. You can record virtually any set of procedural steps for replay, thereby simplifying redundant activities, such as setting preferences and layer/display settings.

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>**Creating Macros**

You can create macros to execute often-performed actions. You can record a series of procedural steps for replay as a single action; you can also nest macros.

#### **Tip**

Dialog box actions are recorded as results rather than actions, so when you replay, you do not see the dialog boxes in the replay process. Because of this you cannot create a macro that stops on an open dialog box; it must follow through to some result or action. For example, you can create a macro that selects Open on the File menu, selects a file, and selects OK. The macro, when played back, opens a file.

[Creating a New Macro](#page-13-1) [Mouse Movement Recording](#page-13-2) [Saving the Macro](#page-14-0)

### <span id="page-13-1"></span>**Creating a New Macro**

Set up a new macro for tasks that SailWind Router may perform frequently.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Output Window** button.
- 2. On the **Macro** tab, click the **New** button. New macros are given a name of Macro#, where # is a numeric sequence such as Macro1 or Macro2.
- 3. You can click the **Compress mouse moves** and/or **Relative mouse moves** buttons. See [Mouse](#page-13-2)  [Movement Recording](#page-13-2)for more information.
- 4. On the **Macro** tab toolbar, click the **Record** button.
- 5. Perform the keystrokes, commands, and mouse clicks to include in the macro.
- 6. On the **Macro** tab toolbar, click the **Stop** button.

**Tip** You can also script a macro instead of recording mouse actions.

### <span id="page-13-2"></span>**Mouse Movement Recording**

You can record mouse movements in macros. You can record compressed or uncompressed mouse movements and relative or absolute movements.

**Compress Mouse Mode**— Compress mouse mode records only the start point and endpoint of a mouse movement. It does not record any of the intermediate coordinates between the start and end points. Compression is recommended under most circumstances because it significantly reduces the size of your macro file. Recording intermediate mouse movements increases the file size, but documents coordinate information if required for a special application.

**Relative Mouse Mode**— Relative mouse mode records the start point and endpoint of a movement in incremental coordinates instead of absolute coordinates.

### <span id="page-14-0"></span>**Saving the Macro**

Save your macro after completing it.

- 1. Click the **Save** button.
- 2. In the standard Windows Save As dialog box, enter a filename, if desired, and click **Save**.

### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**Managing Macros**

Read the following topics to learn more about managing macro files.

[Opening an Existing Macro File](#page-15-1) [Viewing](#page-15-2) Multiple Open Macros [Editing a Macro](#page-16-2) [Saving the Macro Edits](#page-16-3)

### <span id="page-15-1"></span>**Opening an Existing Macro File**

SailWind Router stores the macros you create in (*.mcr*) files. You can use either the menus or the toolbar to open an existing macro file.

![](/router/_page_15_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Tip** You can open multiple macros in the macro editor. The macro editor also supports nested macros.

### **Procedure**

- 1. In the Output Window, click the **Macro** tab.
- 2. Click the **Open** button.
- 3. In the Open File dialog box, select the macro file to open and click **Open**.

### <span id="page-15-2"></span>**Viewing Multiple Open Macros**

You can open multiple macros in the macro editor and switch between them.

### **Procedure**

Click the macro you want to view in the List of Open Macros area of the **Macro** tab.

![](/router/_page_15_Figure_16.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7. The Macro Tab**

### <span id="page-16-2"></span>**Editing a Macro**

You can copy or cut selected text to the Clipboard. After copying text to the Clipboard, you can then paste the selection into the text window or paste the text into other applications. You can also switch between open macros to edit multiple macros.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Select the text you want to copy or cut.
- 2. Right-click in the Output window and click the **Copy** or **Cut** popup menu items.
- 3. Right-click in the Output window and click the **Paste** button. You will see that your selection has been pasted in the Output window at the insertion point.

### <span id="page-16-3"></span>**Saving the Macro Edits**

When you have completed editing the macro, you must save it as described in the following procedure.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Save** button.
- 2. In the standard Windows Save As dialog box, enter a filename, if necessary, and click **Save**.

## <span id="page-16-0"></span>**Playing Back a Macro**

You can play back a macro after creating it. (When you play a macro, you cannot use the mouse in the workspace.)

### **Procedure**

- 1. On the **Macro** tab, click the **Open** button and open a macro (.mcr) file. Recent macros can be found by clicking the **Tools > Macros** menu item. Alternatively, you can right-click in the **Macro** tab and click **Run**.
- 2. On the **Macro** tab toolbar, click the **Run** button.

### **Tip**

Use the **Pause** and **Play** buttons in the **Macro** tab toolbar to pause and play the running macro.

## <span id="page-16-1"></span>**Stopping a Playing Macro**

You can stop the playback of a macro at any time. However, you cannot resume the playback of the macro after stopping it. When you click Run, the macro starts from the beginning.

### **Procedure**

Right-click and click the **Stop** popup menu item.

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Debugging Macro Scripts**

You can play back a macro by either running it step-by-step, or by allowing it to run to a certain point in the script. To perform these debugging tasks, insert breakpoints in the macro script at places where you want the macro to stop.

[Setting and Removing Breakpoints](#page-17-1) [Debugging the Macro Scripts](#page-17-2) [Correcting](#page-18-1) Run-Time Errors

### <span id="page-17-1"></span>**Setting and Removing Breakpoints**

Set and remove breakpoints before debugging a macro. If the macro engine encounters a breakpoint during macro playback, it pauses the macro.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Place the cursor on the line where you want to add a breakpoint.
- 2. Right-click in the **Macro** tab and click the **Toggle Break** popup menu item. This inserts a breakpoint at the current cursor location. A breakpoint marker appears in the gutter area. Alternatively, on the **Macro** tab toolbar, click the **Toggle Breakpoint** button.

### **Results**

When the macro engine encounters a breakpoint while playing back a macro, it pauses the macro. It also marks the next line in the macro with the instruction pointer.

### <span id="page-17-2"></span>**Debugging the Macro Scripts**

You can debug your macros after inserting breakpoints.

Use the commands in the following table for debugging:

[Creating a Script](#page-23-1) [Inserting an Automation Statement Using the Object and Procedure Lists](#page-23-2) [Inserting an Automation Statement Using the ActiveX Automation Members Dialog](#page-23-3) [Setting the Next Statement](#page-24-0) [Showing the Next Statement](#page-24-1) [Saving the Script](#page-24-2)

### <span id="page-23-1"></span>**Creating a Script**

You can write scripts for SailWind Router using the Basic Script Editor.

### **Procedure**

1. Click the **Tools > Basic Scripts > Basic Script Editor** menu item.

The **Basic** tab opens in the Output window.

**Note:**

In SailWind Layout and SailWind Logic, the SAX Basic Engine dialog box appears.

2. Click the **New** button.

### <span id="page-23-2"></span>**Inserting an Automation Statement Using the Object and Procedure Lists**

Use the Object and Procedure lists to select and insert a statement. These lists contain the most commonly used statements.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Click the Object list and click an object type. The Object list shows all the objects for the current module. The (General) object groups all of the procedures that are not part of any specific object.
- 2. Click the Procedure list and click a non-bold procedure to insert. The Procedure list shows all the procedures for the current object. Selecting a procedure that is not bold inserts the proper procedure definition for that procedure.

### **Results**

<span id="page-23-3"></span>The statement appears at the bottom of the script.

### **Inserting an Automation Statement Using the ActiveX Automation Members Dialog**

Use the Object and Procedure lists to select and insert a statement.

#### **CAUTION:**

If the pointer is on any line in the script other than the bottom line, the line is overwritten.

### **Procedure**

- 1. In the Basic Script Editor, right-click and click the **Browse** popup menu item.
- 2. Use the ActiveX Automation Members dialog box to select and insert a statement. This dialog box contains an extensive list of statements.

### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Setting the Next Statement**

You can force a particular line in a script to run next. (You can only select statements in the current subroutine or function.)

### **Procedure**

- 1. In the Basic Script Editor, put your cursor on the line you want to run next.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Set Next Statement** popup menu item.

### **Results**

An instruction pointer appears next to the selected line. This line, and only this line, will run next. If you go to other parts of the script, you can return to this line by clicking **Show Next Statement**.

### <span id="page-24-1"></span>**Showing the Next Statement**

You can use the "Show Next Statement" feature in the Basic Script Editor to locate the next point in the script to run. This feature is especially useful during debugging operations.

### **Procedure**

In the Basic Script Editor, right-click and click the **Show Next Statement** popup menu item.

### **Results**

An instruction pointer indicates the next statement to run. Pausing a running script or setting a statement to run next sets the next statement. You can locate the set statement from anywhere in the script.

### <span id="page-24-2"></span>**Saving the Script**

Store your scripts for future use by saving them from within the Basic Script Editor.

- 1. In the Basic Script Editor, click the **Save** button.
- 2. Type a file name and then click **Save**.

## <span id="page-25-0"></span>**Running Scripts**

You can run an existing script using Run or resume the playback of a paused script. (When you run a script, you cannot use the mouse in the workspace.)

[Running a Script](#page-25-1) [Pausing and Resuming a Running Script](#page-25-2) [Stopping a Running Script](#page-25-3)

### <span id="page-25-1"></span>**Running a Script**

Use the Basic Script Editor to open and run scripts.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Basic Script Editor, open a script file.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Run** popup menu item. Alternatively, on the Basic Script Editor toolbar, click the **Run** button.

### <span id="page-25-2"></span>**Pausing and Resuming a Running Script**

When running a long script, you can pause it to perform some other design activity, and then resume it.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the Basic Script Editor, right-click and click the **Pause** popup menu item. (Or click the **Pause**  button in the toolbar.)
- 2. When you are ready to resume running the script, right-click in the Basic Script Editor and click the **Run**, **Step Over**, or **Step to Cursor** button.

### <span id="page-25-3"></span>**Stopping a Running Script**

You can stop a running script at any time. However, you cannot resume running a script once you have stopped it. When you click **Run**, the script starts from the beginning.

### **Procedure**

In the Basic Script Editor, right-click and click **Stop.** (Or click the **Stop** button in the toolbar.)

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**Debugging Scripts**

When running a script, you can run it step-by-step or to a certain location in the script. To perform these debugging tasks, insert breakpoints in the script at the points at which you want the script to stop.

[Setting or Removing the Breakpoints](#page-26-1) [Debugging the Scripts—Commands](#page-26-2) [Correcting Run-time Errors](#page-27-2)

### <span id="page-26-1"></span>**Setting or Removing the Breakpoints**

The ability to set or remove breakpoints is useful when you debug a script. If the Basic engine encounters a breakpoint when running a script, it pauses the execution of the script. An instruction pointer marks the next line in the script.

### **Procedure**

- 1. Place the cursor on the line where you want to add a breakpoint.
- 2. On the Basic Script Editor toolbar, click the **Toggle Breakpoint** button. Alternatively, in the Basic Editor, right-click and click the **Toggle Break** popup menu item.

### **Results**

<span id="page-26-2"></span>A breakpoint is inserted at the current cursor location. A breakpoint marker appears in the gutter area.

### **Debugging the Scripts—Commands**

You can begin debugging a script after you have inserted breakpoints.

Debug your script using the following commands:

# **Navigation Window**

Use the Navigation window to display a different view of the workspace, in which you can filter the items displayed and see information about objects selected in the workspace.

![](/router/_page_27_Figure_11.jpeg)

#### **Figure 9. Navigation Window**

The content of the Navigation window depends on what is selected in the workspace, as described in the following topics.

### **Nothing Selected**

The view in the Navigation window is magnified, and centers on the location of the pointer in the workspace; when the pointer moves, the view in the Navigator window follows it.

### **Pin or Via Selected**

When you select a pin or via, the Navigation window displays a cross section of the object.([Figure 10\)](#page-28-0). Information that appears includes:

- Pad sizes
- Thermal attachments
- Test point status
- Width
- Layers of attached traces
- Drill size
- Component or via name

<span id="page-28-0"></span>The size of the substrates is proportional to their thickness, which is set in the SailWind Layout Setup Layers dialog box. The pad size reflects non-plane nets on any layers. For plane nets on CAM or split/ mixed layers, the antipad size or thermal pad (showing the inner diameter for a thermal pad) appears.

#### **Figure 10. Pin/Via Cross-Section**

### **Component Selected**

When a component is selected, the navigation window zooms in on the selected component, ([Figure](#page-29-0) 11). The navigation window shows the attached traces and fanouts as well as the component.

<span id="page-29-0"></span>![](/router/_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Figure 11. A Selected Component in the Navigation Window**

### **Net Selected**

<span id="page-29-1"></span>If a net object is selected, the navigation window zooms in on the selected net class, net, pin pair group, pin pair, electrical net, differential pair, or matched length group [\(Figure 12](#page-29-1)).

![](/router/_page_29_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 12. A Selected Net in the Navigation Window**

#### **When Routing Length-Controlled Objects, or Selecting and Placing Components**

When interactively routing length-controlled objects (for example, matched length groups and differential pairs, nets, electrical nets, or pin pairs with length rules), the navigation window monitors the route length. It shows only those nets, electrical nets, or matched length groups that have length rules and are affected by the current operation.

The navigation window shows the same information if you select or place a component that has lengthcontrolled objects attached to it. Length-controlled objects appear in different colors ([Figure 13\)](#page-30-0).

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Spreadsheet Window**

Use the Spreadsheet Window to view and modify properties for all design objects. You can customize how information appears. You can also export the information to an HTML file, letting you share it over the Web with other members of the design team.

By default, the Spreadsheet window has the following tabs:

- **Selected Object**  Displays and changes information about design objects
- **Errors**  View and organize errors and find the errors in the design. Use the **Error** tab to view the type of error, the layer the error is on, the coordinates of the error, and the error description. These fields are for information only and cannot be modified. Also use the **Error** tab to ignore an error.
- **Net Length Monitor**  Dynamically displays trace length values for net objects during interactive routing and route editing. Includes half the Discrete length value of each connected pin of components that have a Discrete length assigned.
- **Electrical Net Length Monitor**  Dynamically displays trace length values for electrical net objects during interactive routing and route editing. Includes half the Discrete length value of each connected pin of components that have a Discrete length assigned.
