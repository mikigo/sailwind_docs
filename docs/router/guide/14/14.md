# **Chapter 14 Virtual Pins**

SailWind Router supports the use of *virtual pins*, which can act as nodes for adding pin pair start or end points.

# <span id="page-0-0"></span>**The Virtual Pin**

A virtual pin is like a component pin that you can add to a net. It becomes a start point and/or end point of one or more new pin pairs. This gives you increased (sub-pin-pair) control over the net. For example, you could use a virtual pin to create distinct matched length pin pairs out of the net's branches.

**Tip** You can also add virtual pins in SailWind Layout.

A virtual pin uses the pad stack of a via. The pad stack can be a through-hole type or partial, or it can be a single-layer pad. You add virtual pins *nets*. When you add a virtual pin to a net, the total number of pin pairs in the net increases by 1, as shown in this example:

You can assign rules to pin pairs ending on virtual pins in the same way as to pin pairs ending on component pins.

In the display, virtual pins are identified with a marker that uses the color of the board outline.

<span id="page-2-0"></span>To work with virtual pins, you need the Advanced Rules license.

### **Virtual Pin Setup**

Use SailWind Layout to set up the virtual pins in your design.

See Via Setup in the *SailWind Layout Guide* for information on how to create, edit, and delete pad stacks for vias and virtual pins.

# <span id="page-2-1"></span>**Adding a Virtual Pin to a Net**

You can add a virtual pin to any net—unrouted, partially-routed, or wholly routed.

When you add a virtual pin to a net, it conforms to the following:

• If the virtual pin you are adding is the first virtual pin in the net, and the net has no pin pair rules and no routing—and has Minimized topology—the software creates the pin pairs between the new virtual pin and each component pin in the net in a "starburst" pattern (with the virtual pin in the center). *This is the only case in which the software creates a starburst pattern.*

Note that if you previously added a virtual pin to the net and deleted it, SailWind Router sets the net topology to Protected; so the virtual pin you are adding, even though it appears to be the first virtual pin in the net, connects only to the nearest component pin, not in a starburst pattern. You must reset the net topology to Minimized to create the starburst pattern with a central virtual pin.

- If the virtual pin you are adding is the first virtual pin in the net, and the net has pin pair rules, or routing, or a topology *other than Minimized*, the new virtual pin connects to the nearest component pin only. The software does not create a starburst pattern.
- If the virtual pin you are adding is not the first virtual pin in the net, it connects to the nearest virtual pin only. The software does not create a starburst pattern.

**Tip** You *cannot* create a starburst pattern by placing a virtual pin on a trace of a routed net.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

• You cannot add a virtual pin to a plane net.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. In the design area, select a net.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Add Virtual Pin** popup menu item. The virtual pin appears on the pointer.
- 3. Click to place the new virtual pin. To stop adding virtual pins, right-click and click the **Cancel** popup menu item.

### **Results**

• If you create a starburst pattern, the software generates the new pin pairs and sets the net topology to Protected. If you set your filter to Select Pin Pairs, you can select each connection. The status bar displays the connection to the virtual pin. Instead of a component and pin number (for example U2.8), it displays the instance of the virtual pin (for example VP2). The software uses the same format (VP*<number>*) in pin pair names, for example VP7—U2.1.

For information on setting design rules for the new pin pairs, see "Properties Dialog Box, Pin Pair Tab."

• If you create a non-starburst configuration, or if you create a starburst configuration and want to reconfigure your pin pairs, you need to reschedule the net. See ""Rescheduling Nets"on page 252" for more information.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Deleting a Virtual Pin**

You can remove a virtual pin from a routed or unrouted connection.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. In the design area with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the virtual pin, right-click, and click the **Delete** popup menu item.

### **Results**

- If the deleted virtual pin has only one connection (routed or unrouted), the software deletes both the virtual pin and its connection.
- If the deleted virtual pin has two or more connections, all unrouted, the software deletes the virtual pin and makes new connections between the component pins and virtual pins to which it was connected.
- If the deleted virtual pin has two or more connections, some or all of which are routed:
	- The software deletes the virtual pin and all its attached pin pairs.
	- Routing (traces and vias) of the deleted pin pairs remains, and the software assigns it new pin pairs.
	- If traces from different layers were attached to the deleted virtual pin, SailWind Router creates one or more zero-length unroutes between junctions on different layers.
	- Unroutes might connect to junctions that replace the virtual pin.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>**Protecting a Virtual Pin**

You can control the protection of virtual pins through the "Protect; disallow editing" check box in the **Virtual Pin** tab of the Virtual Pin Properties dialog box.

![](/router/_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Tip** This check box is also toggled by the **Protect** and **Unprotect** commands in the virtual pin's popup menu.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. In the design area, with nothing selected, right-click and click the **Select Virtual Pins** popup menu item.
- 2. Select the virtual pin then right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. On the **Virtual Pin** tab of the Virtual Pin Properties dialog box, select the "Protect; disallow editing" check box.
- <span id="page-4-1"></span>4. Click **OK**.

### **Changing a Virtual Pin's Via Type**

Change the type of via that a virtual pin uses through its Properties.

#### **Restrictions and Limitations**

• You cannot change a protected via unless you first unprotect it.

#### **Procedure**

- 1. Select the virtual pin, right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 2. On the **Virtual Pin** tab of the Virtual Pin Properties dialog box, select the new via type from the Type list.
- 3. Click **OK**.
