#### **Restriction**

This tutorial requires the General Editing and Dynamic Route Editing security options. In SailWind Router, click **Installed Options** on the Help menu to determine whether you can proceed.

#### **Preparation**

If it is not already running, start SailWind Router and open the file named **previewrules.pcb** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

## **Placement toolbar**

The SailWind Router Placement toolbar contains buttons that represent the component placement commands available in SailWind Router.

#### **To open and close the Placement toolbar:**

On the standard toolbar, click the **Placement** button .

## **Setting the move origin**

# **Options button > Global/General tab**

SailWind Router enables you to choose between three origins for moving objects.

#### These origins include:

| Origin             | Location                                                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| By Cursor Location | The location of the pointer at the time you initiate a component<br>move. |

| By Origin    | The actual component origin as defined in the PCB.                                                                                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| By Mid-Point | The center of the component, calculated by finding the center<br>point of a rectangular box that encompasses the part outline<br>and its pins. |

For the purpose of the exercises below, you will set the move-by mode to Move By Origin.

- 1. In the Object movement area, click **Origin** in the Move object by list.
- 2. In the Drag object using list, make sure that **Drag and attach** is selected.
- 3. Click **OK** to apply the changes and close the Options dialog box.

# **Changing placement properties**

You can view and modify various placement details related to a part using the Properties command.

- 1. With nothing selected, right-click and then click **Select Components**.
- 2. Select a component. With the component selected, right-click and click **Properties**. The Component Properties dialog box appears. **Alternative:** Double click on the component to open the Properties dialog box.
- 3. Click the **Component** tab to display the properties for the selected component.
- 4. To change component properties such as location, orientation, and board side, edit the data in the related box and click **Apply**.

**Requirement:** Design Rules Checking (DRC) will prevent a component from being placed in an illegal location. To turn off checking, type **DRC** and then **Enter**.

- 5. Experiment with changing the orientation or location of a few components using the Component Properties tab.
- 6. When finished, click **OK** to close the Component Properties dialog box.
- 7. Do not save a copy of the file.

# **Pre-placement procedures**

There are several procedures you must complete before you begin to place parts.

## **Set a component placement grid**

- 1. If it is not already running, start SailWind Router and open the file named **previewdispersed.pcb** found in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.
- 2. Set the Component grid to 50 mils by using the shortcut key gc50. Type **gc**. As you type, the Command Argument dialog box appears. Complete the command by pressing the **Spacebar**, typing **50**, and pressing **Enter**.
- 3. Set the Display grid to 50 mils by using the shortcut key gd50. Type **gd**. As you type, the Command Argument dialog box appears. Complete the command by pressing the **Spacebar**, typing **50**, and pressing **Enter**. You may not be able to see the Display grid at the present viewing scale. If you want to see it, just zoom in.

### **Set the net colors**

#### **View menu > Nets**

To aid in the placement and correct orientation of decoupling capacitors, assign a color to the +5V net.

- 1. In the Net list area, expand Net Objects.
- 2. Expand the Nets branch.
- 3. In the Nets list, click **+5V**.
- 4. Click **Add** to add +5V to the View details area.
- 5. In the View details area, click **+5V**.
- 6. Click dark gray in the Palette and then click on the Colors of Pads, Vias, Unroutes box to display all component pins and vias connected to +5V as dark gray.

### **Set the net visibility**

To help determine the best location for components, temporarily make the plane nets invisible.

- 1. With the **+5V** net selected, clear the **Traces** check box to make the net invisible.
- 2. In the Nets list, click the **+12V** and **GND** nets.
- 3. Click **Add** to move them to the View details area.
- 4. In the View details area, click the **+12V** and **GND** nets and clear the **Traces** check box to make them invisible.
- 5. Click **OK** to apply the visibility settings and close the View Nets dialog box.

## **Placing components using move**

In the previous lesson you learned how to configure the Move command for moving and positioning components. You will now use this command to place components for the tutorial design. The component positions are established to efficiently use your time with the tutorial.

**Tip:** Any placement keepouts that may exist in the design are ignored during this section of the tutorial because you are working with On-line DRC disabled. If DRC is enabled, you may be prevented from placing some of the components in this tutorial. Type **DRC** and then press Enter to disable On-line DRC.

### **Place the ICs**

![](/router/_page_3_Picture_3.jpeg)

Place the ICs and their associated decoupling capacitors first.

1. When in verb mode, SailWind Router is in a state where the corresponding action is applied to each selected object. SailWind Router is in verb mode when a "v" appears as part of the pointer. Use this mode whenever you repeatedly move components.

**Alternative:** You can also move components outside of verb mode. With verb mode off, select the component to move and either:

- Press Ctrl+E
- Right-click and click Move.
- Drag the component to the new location.
- 2. Type the shortcut **ss** and in the Shortcut dialog box press the spacebar and then type **u1**. Press **Enter** to search and select U1. U1 attaches to the pointer.
- 3. Position U1 at X**1400**, Y**800** and click to place it.
- 4. Use the shortcut and type **ss u2** to search and select U2.
- 5. With U2 attached to the pointer, move U2 across the board horizontally and note how the nets reconnect as U2 moves. This is called dynamic reconnect.
- 6. Position U2 at X**1400**, Y**1450** and click to place it.
- 7. Place the following components using the Move command:

| Component | X, Y location |
|-----------|---------------|
| U3        | 2050 800      |
| U4        | 2050 1450     |
| U5        | 750 1600      |
| U6        | 750 1250      |
| U7        | 650 800       |

#### **Place the decoupling capacitors**

- 1. With Move Component mode active, use the shortcut **ss** to search and select C1. C1 attaches to the pointer, but its nets do not appear because the +5V and GND nets are invisible.
- 2. To place C1 on the opposite side of the board, right-click and click **Flip Side**. **Tip:** Notice the component outline. Color changes to match the new layer. **Alternative:** Press Shift+F.
- 3. Right-click and click **Rotate 90** twice. Rotate 90 rotates components 90 degrees counterclockwise. Place it under U1 at X1150, Y1000. **Alternative:** Press Ctrl+R.

| Capacitor to place | X, Y location |
|--------------------|---------------|
| C2                 | 500 1000      |
| C3                 | 1950 1550     |
| C4                 | 700 1700      |
| C5                 | 700 1350      |
| C6                 | 1950 900      |
| C10                | 1150 1650     |

4. Repeat the steps above to place the remaining capacitors:

## **Place the Oscillator**

![](/router/_page_4_Picture_7.jpeg)

Use this same method to locate, select, and move oscillator Y1. Notice the behavior of the placement commands when placement keepouts are present.

**Tip:** At this point in the tutorial the DRC mode is set to off. To enable placement keepout checking, you must change the DRC mode to Prevent.

- 1. On the DRC Filter toolbar, click the **DRC Settings** button.
- 2. In the Design Rule Checking dialog box, select the check box in the Enable column for the **Placement** Design Rule, and then select **Prevent** in the Error Response list.
- 3. Click **Close** to close the DRC Settings dialog box and save the settings.
- 4. With Move Component mode active, use the shortcut **ss y1** to search and select Y1. Y1 attaches to the pointer.
- 5. Position Y1 at X2050, Y1100 (between U3 and U4), and click to place it. Notice how you are prevented from placing a component with a height attribute that exceeds the allowable height in the keepout area.
- 6. Rotate Y1 90 degrees by right-clicking and clicking **Spin**, and then place it at X400, Y1400.

**Tip:** To spin the component in coarse radial increments, spin the component with the pointer closer to the component origin. To spin the component in fine radial increments, spin the component with the pointer further from the component origin.

**Alternative:** Press Ctrl+I

7. To disable On-line DRC, click the **DRC On/Off** button on the DRC Filter toolbar so that the button is in the deselected position.

**Tip:** On-line DRC operation and behavior is covered in another tutorial.

# **Placing components using the Project Explorer**

You can also select and move components using the Project Explorer. With the Project Explorer, you can quickly search and locate design components and automatically apply commands like Select, Highlight, and Rotate 90.

### **Place connector J1**

## **Placement toolbar button > Move button**

- 1. In the Project Explorer, locate the Components object.
- 2. Expand the Components object tree.
- 3. Scroll through the Components list. Click to select **J1**.
- 4. Right-click in the design area and click **Flip Side**. Click at X1650, Y400 to place J1.

### **Place capacitor C7 on the secondary component side**

- 1. In the Project Explorer, scroll through the Components list. Click to select **C7**.
- 2. Right-click in the design area and click **Flip Side**.
- 3. Rotate C7 180 degrees by pressing **Ctrl+R** twice, and place it at X400, Y1550.

# **Experimenting with placement tools**

Place transistor Q1 and its filter capacitors C8 and C9 using any of the placement methods previously described in this tutorial. Place the components at:

| Component | X, Y location                           |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Q1        | 3100 1200 with a rotation of 90 degrees |
| C8        | 2100 400                                |
| C9        | 2100 1800                               |
| R1        | 2050 550                                |
| R2        | 2050 1200                               |
| R5        | 400 1700                                |
