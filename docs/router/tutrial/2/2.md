# **Assigning Constraints**

Design rules include clearance, routing, and high-speed constraints assigned as default restrictions for nets, layers, classes, or pin pairs. In addition, you can assign conditional, differential pair, decal and component rules.

#### **In this lesson:**

- Setting default clearance rules
- Setting default routing rules
- Setting net clearance rules
- Creating a net class rule set
- Setting conditional rules

#### **Restriction**

This tutorial requires the General Editing and Advanced Rules security options. In SailWind Router, click **Installed Options** on the Help menu to determine whether you can proceed.

#### **Preparation**

If it is not already running, start SailWind Router and open the file named **previewnet.pcb** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

# **Setting default clearance rules**

# **Properties button > Clearance tab**

With SailWind Router, you can define the SailWind Layout clearance, routing, fanout and pad entry constraints for each level of the design rule hierarchy.

The Clearance tab contains a matrix of PCB design data. The matrix lets you specify values for any or all data types.

- 1. Set a global default clearance value by clicking **All** in the upper left corner of the clearance matrix. A dialog box appears.
- 2. Type **8** and click **OK**. All matrix values change simultaneously.
- 3. Click the **Routing** tab. In the Trace Width area, type **6** in the Minimum box, type **8** in the Recommended box, and type **12** in the Maximum box.
- 4. Click the **Same net** tab. Set a global Same Net default clearance value by clicking **All** in the upper left corner of the **Object clearance** matrix. A dialog box appears.
- 5. Type **12** and click **OK**. All matrix values change simultaneously.
- 6. To save the changes, click **OK** in the Design Properties dialog box.

# **Setting default routing rules**

### **Properties button > Layer Biasing tab**

To avoid routing on the plane layers, remove them from the selected routing layers as defined in the routing rules. The Layer Biasing tab contains a list of selected routing layers. This list lets you specify which layers are permitted for routing.

- 1. Clear the check boxes in the **Allow Routing** column for the Power Plane layer to prevent routing on the plane layers. The check box for the Ground Plane layer (defined as a CAM plane) may have a check in the box but is automatically disabled because of its layer status.
- 2. Click **OK** to close the Design Properties dialog box.

### **Setting net clearance rules**

#### **Project Explorer > Net Objects**

You can assign net-specific clearances that take precedence over the default rules previously entered.

- 1. Double-click on the **Net Objects** item. Double-click on the **Nets** item to expand the tree and show the list of all nets.
- 2. Scroll through the Nets list. Ctrl+click to select nets **+5V**, **+12V**, and **GND**. Right-click and click **Properties**. The three nets are represented by the Net Properties dialog box.
- 3. Click the **Clearance** tab, and set a clearance value by clicking **All** in the upper left corner of the matrix. A dialog box appears.
- 4. Type **10** as the global clearance and click **OK**.
- 5. Click the **Routing** tab. In the Trace Width area, type **10** in the Minimum box, type **12** in the Recommended box, and type **15** in the Maximum box.
- 6. Click **OK** to close the Net Properties dialog box and save the changes.

### **Setting net clearance rules**

You can create or modify rule sets in the Project Explorer. In this exercise, you'll create a net class in the Project Explorer.

- 1. Click the plus sign (+) to the left of Net Objects in the object list. The tree expands.
- 2. Click the plus sign (+) to the left of Nets in the Net Objects tree. The Nets branch expands to show all nets in the design.
- 3. Scroll through the list of nets and select net **A00**. Do not expand the A00 branch. Note how the net is also selected in the workspace.
- 4. Scroll through the list, press **Shift**, and click net **A14** to select the set of address line nets.
- 5. Drag and drop to copy the selected nets to the Net Classes branch of the Net Objects tree. **Tip:** Since the Net Classes branch is not visible in the Project Explorer, drag your selection to the top of the Project Explorer to force the list to scroll. This lets you drop the selection in the Net Classes branch. The branch expands and you can see that you have created net class Class1.

#### **Renaming a net class**

If you do not want to use the default assigned name, you can rename the net class.

- 1. Select the **Class1** net class.
- 2. Right-click and click **Rename**. The Class1 name is highlighted, and you are in an edit mode.
- 3. Type **Address** and press **Enter** to rename the net class.

# **Setting conditional rules**

Conditional design rules are rules that come into play when objects meet certain conditions such as when a net is routed near another net or other design object. A conditional rule is most often used when two nets are routed in close proximity to avoid adverse effects on the circuitry like crosstalk. An example might be the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) requirement of segregating primary, secondary, and ground nets when alternating current is directly connected to the PCB. You can assign conditional rules between most components of the design rule hierarchy. Conditional rules can exist between nets, nets and classes, classes and classes, nets and layers, and so on.

#### **Creating a conditional rule**

You can create or modify design objects in the Project Explorer. In this exercise, you'll create a conditional rule in the Project Explorer.

- 1. In the Nets branch of the Net Objects tree, select net **+5V**.
- 2. Do not expand the +5V branch. Note how the net is also selected in the workspace.
- 3. Ctrl and click net **+12V**. Then right-click and click **Copy**.
- 5. Scroll down, point to Conditional Rules, right-click and click **Paste**.
- 6. Double-click to expand the Conditional Rules branch. You can see that you created the conditional rule +5V : +12V (All layers).

#### **Assigning a conditional rule**

- 1. Click the conditional rule **+5V : +12V (All layers)** to select the rule.
- 2. Right-click, click **Properties. Result:** The **Clearance** tab dialog box for the selected nets appears. The existing value boxes appear yellow because the nets already have non-default net rules set in a previous step.
- 3. Set a global clearance value by clicking **All** in the upper left corner of the matrix. A dialog box appears.
- 4. Type **25** as the global clearance and click **OK**.
- 5. Click **OK** to close the Conditional Rule dialog box.
- 6. Do not save a copy of the design.
