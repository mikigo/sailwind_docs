# **Autorouting with SailWind Router**

Before autorouting, settings are checked to ensure the autorouter will route to your expectations.

#### **In this lesson:**

- Setting units of measure
- Setting grids
- Setting net visibility and length minimization
- Autoroute options
- Autorouting by selection
- Autorouting the design

#### **Restriction**

This tutorial requires the Advanced Rules, General Editing, and Route security options. In SailWind Router, click **Installed Options** on the Help menu to determine whether you can proceed.

### **Preparation**

If it is not already running, start SailWind Router and open the file named **previewpreroute.pcb** in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.

# **Setting units of measure**

**Options button > Global/General tab**

You can change the unit of measure to inches, mils, or metric units.

- 1. The Design units settings are on this tab. Leave the current design units set to **Mils**.
- 2. Click **OK** to close the Options dialog box.

# **Setting grids**

### **SailWind Router has five working grids, plus a visible grid:**

| Grid       | Purpose                                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Display    | Dot grid used as a visual aid                                |
| Routing    | Establishes minimum snap distance during routing and editing |
| Test Point | Establishes spacing and location of test points              |
| Via        | Establishes spacing and location of vias                     |

| Fanout    | Establishes spacing and location of vias inserted during fanout<br>operations        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Component | Establishes spacing and location of component origins during placement<br>operations |

You will set several grids in this tutorial.

### **Setting the display grid**

#### **right-click > Properties > Grid tab**

The dots in this grid are just a visual aid.

- 1. In the Displayed row, click in the **X Increment** box.
- 2. Type the value you want to use for the Display grid, for example, **50**.
- 3. Repeat this for the Y Increment box.
- 4. To disable the Display grid, set the values in the X Increment and Y Increment boxes to a small value, such as **10**. It is not actually disabled, but you will not see it unless you zoom in significantly.

### **Setting the working grids**

The spacing for each grid is individually set on the Design Properties dialog box.

**Tip:** To take advantage of the shaped-based architecture of SailWind Router, disable the Snap grid in your design. This lets you maintain grid values but SailWind Router ignores them during autorouting.

#### **To turn off snap-to-grid for the design grids:**

- 1. In the Design Properties dialog box, click the **Grid** tab.
- 2. Clear the check boxes in the Snap Objects to Grid column for the **Routing**, **Test Point**, **Via**, and **Fanout** rows.
- 3. Click **OK** to close the dialog box and apply the changes.

## **Setting net visibility and length minimization**

### **View menu > Nets**

You must make a few updates to the design file to prepare it for proper routing in SailWind Router. Before you can route the plane nets, you need to enable plane net display.

- 1. Select the check boxes in the Traces column to enable display of the routed portions of the following nets: **+12V**, **+5V**, and **GND**.
- 2. If necessary, for each of the plane nets, click **All except connected to plane** to limit the display of the nets to only the routed portions.
- 3. Click the color tile in the Colors of Pads, Vias, Unroutes column to turn off the color for the +5V net.
- 4. Click **OK** to apply the changes and close the View Nets dialog box. **Result:** The updated display of the nets reveals that the lengths for the plane nets were not minimized.
- 5. On the Tools menu click Length Minimization to perform a whole board net length minimization

## **Autoroute options**

There are several options that specify how SailWind Router should autoroute, including the routing angle, pad entry quality, fanout pattern, and testability.

## **Assigning routing options**

## **Options button > Routing/General tab**

You use routing options to specify the routing angle, pad entry quality, and miter options.

- 1. In the Routing angle area, click **Diagonal**.
- 2. In the Miters area, type **3.5** in the **Ratio** box, and type **180** in the **Angle** box.
- 3. Click **OK** to close the Options dialog box and apply the changes.

## **Assigning pad entry options**

#### **right-click > Properties > Pad Entry tab**

- 1. In the Enter pads through area, clear the **Any angle** box to establish pad entry preferences.
- 2. Clear the **Ignore first corner rules to complete traces when required** box.

## **Assigning fanout options**

#### **right-click > Properties > Fanout tab**

Fanout options specify the fanout alignment, spacing, direction, and other settings for the fanout pattern.

- 1. In the Placement of via fanout for area, select the SOIC/QUAD tab.
- 2. In the Alignment list, select **Aligned, single row**.
- 3. In the Direction list, select **Both sides**.
- 4. In the Spacing list, select **Use Grid**.
- 5. In the Create fanouts area, clear the **Signal nets** and **Unused nets** boxes. Leave the **Plane nets** check box selected. Leave all of the check boxes in the Allow multiple connection to area selected.
- 6. In the Fanout length area, leave the **Unlimited** box selected.
- 7. Click **OK** to close the Properties dialog box and apply the changes.

## **Autorouting by selection**

You can autoroute the entire design or only selected objects. Before you autoroute the entire design, you must define how SailWind Router should complete the design by defining a strategy.

SailWind Router has many ways to autoroute a design. You can select components, nets, or pins and apply an autorouting pass type to the selected objects (such as Fanout, Route, or Optimize), or you can use the Autoroute command to autoroute the entire design.

#### **To apply pass types to selected objects:**

- 1. Open the file named **previewrouter.pcb** found in the \ SailWind Projects\Samples folder.
- 2. In the Project Explorer, locate the Components object.
- 3. Expand the Components tree to show the list of all components.
- 4. Scroll through the Components list. Ctrl+click **U1** and **U2**. U1 and U2 are the large SOICs in the center of the design.
- 5. With U1 and U2 selected, right-click in the workspace, and click **Fanout**.

**Result:** After a few moments, several component pins are dispersed to vias according to the Fanout options previously set. When the command is finished, all selected items are deselected automatically.

**Tip:** You can also use Fanout, Route, or Optimize pass types in verb mode. Verb mode is a state in which you click a command such as Fanout, and then SailWind Router applies the currently active command repeatedly to serial selections.

## **Autorouting the design**

In addition to autoroute by selection, you can choose to autoroute the entire design at once.

### **Defining an autorouting strategy**

## **Options button > Routing/Strategy tab**

Before autorouting an entire design, define a routing strategy. You can run one or more of the seven pass types on your design. Within the Strategy tab, you can also define the order in which to route components or nets.

#### **To set a routing strategy:**

1. Select which pass types to run by determining what processes are required in your design. For this tutorial, in the Pass definition area, click Fanout in the Pass Type column to highlight the Fanout pass type so you can set it up to disperse the connections from the larger SOICs in the center of the design. There are eight pass types. Each pass type performs a specific autorouting function. Each pass contains one or more subpasses.

#### **Pass Types:**

| Pass Type  | Description                                                                                                                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fanout     | Disperses unroutes from SMD pads using short traces<br>connected to a via.                                                             |
| Patterns   | Detects unroute patterns and completes them in a Z or C<br>pattern.                                                                    |
| Route      | Completes unroutes.                                                                                                                    |
| Optimize   | Reviews all trace patterns and attempts to improve the trace<br>pattern quality by reducing via usage and overall trace length.        |
| Center     | Centers traces between objects such as pins and vias.                                                                                  |
| Miters     | Locates all trace corners of a specified angle and adds a miter<br>to the corner.                                                      |
| Test Point | Performs a testability analysis on each<br>net and adds or<br>assigns test points as required, goal is to achieve 100%<br>testability. |
| Tune       | Adjusts length of nets with minimum, maximum, and matched<br>length constraints.                                                       |

The combination of pass types you use varies per design. For most PCB designs, however, the default strategy, which uses the Route and Optimize passes, is sufficient.

- 2. Define a routing order to define the specific order in which to route objects or to limit the application of a pass type to specific objects.
	- a. In the Routing order definition area, expand the Components tree, scroll through the list, and select U3. Shift+click U6. U3 through U6 are selected in the design and in the object list.
	- b. Click **Selected** to add the components to the Routing Order list.
	- c. Select **All Nets** in the Routing Order list and press the **Delete** button to remove All Nets from the Routing Order list.

**Result:** This excludes all other nets from the fanout operation.

- 3. Select the **Pass** check box for the Fanout pass type to enable the pass.
- 4. Click **OK** to apply the changes and close the Options dialog box.

### **Starting Autorouting**

![](/router/_page_4_Picture_11.jpeg)

You can also press F4 to start autorouting. As each autorouting pass completes, the results appear in the Status tab of the command window.

If the command window isn't open, open it:

On the standard toolbar, click the **Command Window** button.

When autorouting completes, a link to a routing report appears in the Status tab of the command window.

**Tip:** In addition to the rules defined in this tutorial lesson, SailWind Router supports autorouting with high-speed rules including minimum, maximum, and matched length, differential pairs, and trace tuning with accordions or meanders.

### **Using Pause and Resume**

You can pause, resume, or stop the autorouting process at any time during autorouting. This lets you review your progress and either stop autorouting to make changes to your strategy or continue the current autorouting operation.

#### **Pause and resume autorouting**

Pause suspends the current autorouting operation. When you resume, the autorouting operation continues from where you paused.

- 1. During autorouting, click the **Pause Autorouting** button on the Routing toolbar. **Tip:** You can set the Pause feature in Tools menu > Options > Strategy tab for each of the pass types.
- 2. Experiment with zoom to review the current results of autorouting.
- 3. On the Routing toolbar, click the **Resume Autorouting** button to resume autorouting.
- 4. When finished, do not save a copy of the design.
