## Routing to length with the trace length monitor
The trace length monitor is a graphical aid for monitoring trace length. The monitor consists of an expanded pointer graphic showing trace length data. When you enable the trace length monitor, trace length information for the object being routed appears as part of the pointer graphic to help you manage trace length.

There are two types of pointer graphics for monitoring trace length. One for monitoring traces without length rules and another for monitoring traces with length rules. This lesson discusses using the trace length monitor for routing traces with length rules.

**See also:** "Monitoring trace length" in *SailWind Router Help* or "Interactively routing with the trace length monitor" in the *Routing Concepts Guide*

**Enabling the trace length monitor**

**Options button > Global/General tab**

Turn on the trace length monitor in the **Global/General** tab of the Options dialog box or by using the Ctrl+L shortcut command.

**To enable the trace length monitor:**

- 1. In the Pointer settings area, select the **Length monitor** check box to enable the trace length monitor.
- 2. In the Highlighted object display area, select **Turning off highlighting** in the distinguish highlighted objects by list
- 3. Click **OK** to accept any changes and close the Options dialog box.

**Creating a length rule**

Before you can use the trace length monitor, you must create a length rule for a net. In this exercise, you'll create a length rule in the Project Explorer.

- 1. In the Project Explorer, locate Net Objects.
- 2. Expand the Net Objects branch.
- 3. Expand the Nets branch to show all nets in the design.
- 4. Scroll through the list of nets and select net **CLKIN**. Do not expand the CLKIN branch. Notice that the net is also selected in the workspace.
- 5. Right-click and click **Properties**.
- 6. In the Net Properties dialog box, click the **Length** tab. Select the **Restrict length** box to enable length rules for this net.
- 7. In the Minimum length box, type **1000** to indicate that the finished trace must be at least one inch long.
- 8. In the Maximum length box, type **2000** to indicate that the finished trace must be no longer than two inches in length.
- 9. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the dialog box.

Now that you have established a length rule for the net, you can monitor adherence to this rule as you route. SailWind Router has several ways to monitor length rules.

**Graphics for traces with length rules**

The trace length monitor presents trace length as a goal for traces with length rules. The trace length monitor shows key trace length data whenever you are interactively routing.

When you select any point along a trace (with length rules) and begin interactive routing, the trace length monitor updates a bar graph as shown below. The numeric data appears in the current system units and updates as you move the trace end point.

The progress indicator is a vertical 5-pixel wide bar that moves from left to right as the trace length increases. As trace length decreases the progress indicator moves from right to left.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Tip:** Size shown may not be actual size.

**The following length information is presented in the trace length monitor:**

| Trace length monitor shows: | Which represents:                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Routed Length (Rt)          | The current length of added trace segments.                                 |
| Minimum Length              | The minimum length rule for the net or pin pair.                            |
| Maximum Length              | The maximum length rule for the net or pin pair.                            |
| Estimated Length (Et)       | The estimated length of trace segments and<br>remaining Manhattan distance. |

**Color indicators**

When a length rule has been assigned, the trace length monitor will display colors to indicate the length progress.

**Monitor Colors:**

| Color                     | Meaning                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Yellow length monitor     | Estimated trace length < min trace length rule        |
| Green length monitor      | Estimated trace length is between min and max lengths |
| Dark green length monitor | Estimated trace length is at 90% of max length        |
| Red length monitor        | Estimated trace length exceeds max length             |

**Routing traces with the trace length monitor**

Use the trace length monitor to view length information for a trace while you route it.

- 1. With nothing selected, right-click and click **Select Traces/Pins/Unroutes**.
- 2. In the standard toolbar, select **Primary Component Side** in the Layer list to set it as the current layer.
- 3. Select the pin or the unroute attached to the net CLKIN at the bottom left corner of the board.

**Tip:** You can use the Project Explorer to locate the net in the design. Find the CLKIN net by selecting it in the Nets branch of the Project Explorer.

**Result:** The net highlights in the workspace.

4. Click on the unroute or the pin from which you want to start routing.

- 5. Right-click and click **Interactive Route**.
	- **Alternative:** Press F3.

**Result:** The beginning of a new trace segment attaches to the pointer. The trace length monitor appears at the pointer location.

6. Move the pointer around and notice how the values change in the trace length monitor. This helps you determine how close you are to the length you want as you route.

Notice how the trace length monitor changes color.

**Tip:** The color changes are also visible in the Length Monitor tab of the spreadsheet window and in the navigation window.

7. When the trace is an acceptable length, complete the trace.

Try adding length rules and routing traces with length rules until you are comfortable with the techniques.

**See also:** "Interactively monitoring with the trace length monitor" in the *Routing Concepts Guide*

## Adding accordions interactively
When you route traces with length rules, you may have to add additional length to the traces in order to meet the length requirements. You can sometimes add length to a trace in a defined space by using accordions.

Accordions are patterns, created with trace elements, that resemble a signal wave. The patterns are typically contiguous and do not include layer changes.

Amplitude and gap define an accordion. Amplitude sets the height of the accordion and gap defines the pitch between accordions. This applies to both horizontal and vertical orientations.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_3_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Setting the accordion gap and amplitude**

**Options button > Routing/Tune tab**

The minimum accordion gap and amplitude settings are defined on the Routing/Tune tab of the Options dialog box.

**Use the following method to set the defaults for accordions:**

- 1. In the Routing to length constraints area, examine the default parameters in the Accordion area.
- 2. In the Minimum amplitude (times trace width) box, click the up arrow until the value reads **10**.

**Result:** This sets the amplitude of the accordion to 10 times the trace width.

3. In the Minimum gap (times trace to corner clearance) box, click the up arrow until the value reads **3**.

**Result:** This sets the gap of the accordion to 3 times the trace-to-corner clearance.

4. Click **OK** to accept the settings and close the Options dialog box.

**Adding accordions**

You use Add Accordion to interactively define accordions. The command is not used to complete trace routing and can only be used during interactive routing. You start this command during interactive routing by right-clicking and clicking Add Accordion.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_4_Figure_12.jpeg)

Using Add Accordion, you can interactively add an interval of an accordion on each mouse click in the same way that a mouse click adds a corner during interactive routing.

After you start Add Accordion, a partial accordion pattern is created and is attached by its end point to the pointer. Move the pointer up or down to stretch the amplitude of the accordion and click to define the first interval. Repeat the steps to continue defining the accordion. To complete the accordion and return to the interactive route command, double-click.

**Adding an accordion**

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Defining the start point for an automatic accordion**

Once you begin Add Accordion, you have several ways to define the accordion. To use automatic definition, you simply move the pointer away from the start point of the Add Accordion command as defined above.

You can also define the start of the accordion and maintain the default minimum amplitude. To do this, begin Add Accordion and, with the end point of the accordion attached to the pointer, click to position the first bend of the accordion.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_5_Figure_5.jpeg)

**To add an accordion while routing:**

- 1. Select the **CLKIN** net in the Nets branch of the Project Explorer. Right-click in the design area and click Unroute. This unroutes the length restricted net that was created earlier in the tutorial.
- 2. With nothing selected, right-click, and click **Select Traces/Pins/Unroutes**.
- 3. In the Layer list on the standard toolbar, click **Primary Component Side** to set it as the current layer.
- 4. Right-click and click **Interactive Route** to begin routing the net. **Alternative:** Select one of the pins associated with the CLKIN net and press **F3**. **Tip:** To view trace length while adding accordions, press Ctrl+L to see the trace length monitor.
- 5. Add a few corners while routing the trace toward an open area of the board.
- 6. With the trace still attached to the pointer, right-click and click **Add Accordion**.

**Tip:** Add Accordion inserts a corner at the start point of the accordion. If you try to start an accordion at an existing corner location, the command may not start the accordion due to a conflict between the corners. For best results, do not start at an existing corner location.

- 7. Drag the pointer in the direction you want. Notice that SailWind Router begins to add accordion sections with the default values for gap and amplitude.
- 8. Add the number of accordion sections you want, and then double-click to complete the accordion.

**Alternative:** Right-click and click **Complete Accordion**.

9. Route the trace to completion.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)

**See also:** "Adding length to traces" in *SailWind Router Help*.

**Creating custom accordions**

During Add Accordion operations, each click results in the addition of an accordion interval. You can combine manual and automatic accordion definition to create customized accordion patterns.

You define the accordion by defining the starting point with a click. Then you create an amplitude and define the next point of the accordion with a click then drag the pointer. The automatic accordion definition feature is applied.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_6_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Tip:** Defining a manual accordion does not affect the default accordion assigned in the Routing tab of the Options dialog box. The next time you use Add Accordion, the default values apply. Practice adding custom accordions and experimenting with setting different amplitudes at various locations in the accordion.

## Interactive routing of differential pairs
You can use differential pairs routing when you create many high-speed designs. By routing certain critical traces as differential pairs you control signal skew, timing windows, and susceptibility to interference.

In order to route differential pair traces, you need to understand the terminology for the various features of a differential pair trace. The following graphic shows the various elements of a differential pair.

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg)

The objective is to route the differential signals from their source pins, around any immediate obstacles, and bring them together at a common point (called the gathering point) to begin the controlled gap part of the trace. The area between the source pins and the gathering point is the start zone.

The objective at the other end is to bring the controlled gap part of the differential pair trace as close as possible to the destination pins (the split point), route around any immediate obstacles, and complete the trace. The area between the split point and the destination pins is the end zone.

**Shoulder length**

The shoulder length can be either the measured length of a trace from its source pin to the gathering point or the measured length of a trace from the split point to its destination pin.

**See also:** "Creating differential pair traces" in the *SailWind Router Help*

**Obstacles**

In general you don't want to route differential pairs around objects such as vias and pins. The only exceptions are for pin escape in the start and end zones of the trace.

**Tip:** Using the Split command, the interactive router can route around obstacles at any time and has no restrictions on the number or size of obstacles.

**Creating a differential pair**

1. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects tree.

- 2. Expand the Nets branch to show all nets in the design.
- 3. Scroll through the list of nets and select net **\$\$\$7651**. Do not expand the \$\$\$7651 branch. **Result:** The net is also selected in the workspace.
- 4. Scroll through the list, press **Ctrl**, and click net **\$\$\$7652**.
- 5. Copy and Paste, or drag and drop to copy the selected nets to the Differential Pairs branch of the Net tree.

**Tip:** This lets you paste, or drop the selection in the Differential Pairs branch. Expand the branch and you can see that the differential pair **\$\$\$7651<->\$\$\$7652** is created.

**Assigning differential pair rules**

- 1. Click the differential pair **\$\$\$7651<->\$\$\$7652** to select the pair.
- 2. Right-click and click **Properties**. The Differential Pair Properties dialog box appears for the selected nets.

**Tip:** You can use the Differential Pair Properties dialog box to set the properties for more than one pair at a time.

- 3. In the Gap between objects when routing box, type **8** to set the routing gap to 8 mils.
- 4. In the Length area, type **1500** in the Minimum box to establish a shoulder length minimum for the pair of 1.5 inches.
- 5. In the Length area, type **2500** in the Maximum box to establish a shoulder length maximum for the pair of 2.5 inches
- 6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the dialog box.

**Routing the differential pair**

You will now route the differential pair that you just created.

- 1. With nothing selected, right-click, and click **Select Traces/Pins/Unroutes**.
- 2. In the Layer list on the standard toolbar, click the **Primary Component Side** to set it as the current layer.
- 3. In the Project Explorer, select one of the nets (**\$\$\$7651** or **\$\$\$7652**) in the Nets list. **Result:** The net is highlighted in the workspace.
- 4. Select the unroute or the pin from which you want to start routing.
- 5. Right-click and click **Interactive Route**. **Alternative:** Press F3.

**Result:** Both members of the differential pair are automatically selected and attached to the pointer.

6. Without clicking, move the pointer around.

**Result:** Traces attempt to join together as a pair as soon as they leave their source pins.

7. Start routing the traces away from the source pins. Click to establish the first corner and anchor the pair.

**Result:** The traces route on the centerline between the two traces.

- 8. Continue to route in the direction of the destination pins.
- 9. As you approach the destination pins, right-click and click **Complete**.

**Tip:** Use the Trace Length Monitor to ensure the nets are within length restrictions otherwise the autorouter may choose a different topology to complete the trace within the rules. SailWind Router automatically completes both traces of the differential pair and may meander its path to ensure length restrictions are met.

10. Experiment with defining and routing additional differential pairs. When you are comfortable with the techniques, continue with the next part of this lesson.

**Route separately**

At times you may want to route differential pairs individually to escape from a connector or BGA pins. Using Route Separately you can split the pairs and route each trace separately, switch between the traces, and rejoin them to continue routing them as a pair.

- 1. Using the Project Explorer, select the **\$\$\$7651<->\$\$\$7652** differential pair that you created in the previous example.
- 2. Once the pair is highlighted in the design, right-click in the design area and click **Unroute**.
- 3. Click the pin or an unroute attached to one of the nets (**\$\$\$7651** or **\$\$\$7652**).
- 4. Right-click and click **Interactive Route**. Both traces of the differential pair are selected and attached to the pointer.
- 5. Start routing the traces away from the source pins and click to establish the first corner and anchor the pair.
- 6. Continue to route in the direction of the destination pins.
- 7. As you approach the destination pins, right-click and click **Route Separately**. **Result:** The pointer attaches to the end of one of the traces.
- 8. Route the trace for a short distance, add a corner, and then right-click, and click **Switch Trace**.

**Result:** The pointer detaches from the current trace and attaches to the end of the other differential pair trace.

- 9. Route this trace for a short distance and click to add a corner.
- 10. Right-click, and click **Route Separately** to end routing separately and continue routing.
- 11. As you approach the destination pins, right-click and click **Complete**.

**Tip:** Use the Trace Length Monitor to ensure the nets are within length restrictions otherwise the autorouter may choose a different topology to complete the trace within the rules. SailWind Router automatically completes both traces of the differential pair.

You can also use Route Separately to complete pair traces individually at their destination pins, such as when finishing the traces at a connector.

- 1. Unroute the pair.
- 2. Route the pair differentially from the source pins. As you approach the destination pins, right-click, and click **Route Separately**.
- 3. With the pointer attached to one trace of the pair, route it to its destination pin. When you reach the destination pin, click to complete the trace.

**Result:** The pointer automatically attaches to the end of the other trace.

4. Route the second trace to its destination pin and click to complete the trace.

Continue to experiment with the Route Separately command, trying different combinations of routing modes to complete differential pairs.

**Adding via pairs**

While routing differential pair traces, you may want to transition layers by using vias. SailWind Router inserts pairs of vias when routing differential pairs.

It is preferable to route differential pair traces without using vias. When you use vias to change layers, you should try to keep them in a close, symmetrical pattern and minimize the lengths of connecting stubs. When you add vias, they are placed in one of the following patterns:

![](/router/tutrial/6/_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

You can add via pairs to the design in any orientation.

- 1. Unroute the pair from the last example.
- 2. Start routing the pair as described in the last example.
- 3. To add a via pair, right-click and click **Add Via**.

**Result:** A pair of vias is inserted at the pointer location.

- 4. To rotate the via pair, right-click, point to **Via Pattern**, and click a new via pattern.
- 5. Continue routing the pair on another layer. Add another via pair to return to the current routing layer.
- 6. As you approach the destination pins, right-click and click **Complete**. **Result:** SailWind Router automatically completes both traces of the differential pair.

**Splitting differential pairs**

When routing differential pairs, it is sometimes necessary to split the pair for a short distance to route around an obstacle such as a component pin or a via. Use the split command to temporarily split the pair and route around an obstacle.

- 1. Unroute the pair.
- 2. With nothing selected, right-click, and click **Select Traces/Pins/Unroutes**.
- 3. Using the pair in the above example, click the pin or an unroute attached to one of the nets (**\$\$\$7651** or **\$\$\$7652**).
- 4. Right-click and click **Interactive Route**.
- 5. Start routing the traces away from the source pins and add a corner to anchor the pair.
- 6. Continue to route the pair toward a row of component pins so that you can try to route the pair between the pins. There is not enough space for the pair to pass between the pins. There is, however, enough clearance to pass the traces individually between the pins.
- 7. As you approach the pins, right-click, and click **Split Trace Segments. Alternative:** Shift+X. **Result:** The traces can now split apart like they do when you start a differential pair trace at a component. This lets the traces pass around a pin.
- 8. Click to end the Split command and return to routing differential pairs.
- 9. Route the pair to completion. If you encounter another obstacle, use the Split command to pass around it.
- 10. As you approach the destination pins, right-click and click **Complete**. SailWind Router automatically completes both traces of the differential pair.

**Tip:** The Split command inserts a corner at the split point. If you try to split a pair at an existing corner location, it may not split due to a conflict between the corners. For best results, do not start the Split command at an existing corner location.

Experiment with the Split command and try to route around different obstacle types.

## Graphical feedback in the navigation window
**Navigation Window button**

As you route traces with length rules, the Navigation window provides real-time feedback on your compliance with net length rules.

- 1. Unroute the pair and click the pin or an unroute attached to one of the nets (**\$\$\$7651** or **\$\$\$7652**).
- 2. Right-click and click **Interactive Route**.
- 3. Start routing the traces away from the source pins and click to establish the first corner and anchor the pair. As you begin routing, an image of the traces appears in the Navigation window.
- 4. Continue to route in the direction of the destination pins.
- 5. Move the pointer around and notice how the color of the traces changes in the Navigation window. This helps you determine how close you are to achieving the rule length as you route.
- 6. Notice how the trace image changes color from yellow to green as you approach the desired trace length. Also notice that the trace image changes to red if you exceed the maximum length.
- 7. When the trace is an acceptable length, right-click and click **Complete**.
- 8. Do not save a copy of the design.

The Navigation window provides information similar to the trace length monitor. The Navigation window also shows color-coded information during other operations such as placement and moving components. This helps you visualize and predict compliance with length rules as you position and move components and other design objects.

## Defining high-speed rules
SailWind Router supports routing of traces with high-speed rules including length-controlled and matched length for nets and pin pairs. These can be defined for individual nets and pin pairs or for net and pin pair groups. You can also define routing and clearance rules individually for components.

## Interactive routing to matched length rules
Matched length rules specify a target length and tolerance for a group of nets to match their lengths after routing. This task is usually performed by the autorouter, though it can be performed manually, one trace at a time. Typically, you can use the Spreadsheet window to monitor the length.

**Defining a matched length net group**

You can create or modify design objects in the Project Explorer. In this exercise, you'll create a matched length net group rule in the Project Explorer.

- 1. Expand the Nets Objects tree.
- 2. Expand the Nets branch to show all nets in the design.
- 3. Scroll through the list of nets and select net **A00**. Do not expand the A00 branch. Notice how the net is also selected in the workspace.
- 4. Scroll through the list, press **Shift**, and click net **A07**.
- 5. Drag the selected objects to the Matched Length Net Groups branch of the Net Objects tree. **Tip:** If the Matched Length Net Groups branch is not visible in the Project Explorer, drag your selection to the top of the Project Explorer, forcing the list to scroll. This lets you drop the selection in the Matched Length Net Groups branch.
- 6. The branch expands and you can see that a new Matched Length Net Group is created. **Result:** SailWind Router temporarily assigns a default name of MLNetGroup1 to the group.
- 7. Type the name **AddressBus** and press **Enter** to accept the new name.

You created a Matched Length Net Group for the first eight signal nets of the address bus.

**Assigning matched length net group rules**

You will now assign the required length rules to the nets in this group:

- 1. Select the Matched Length Net Group **AddressBus**.
- 2. Right-click and click **Properties**. **Result:** The Matched Length Group Properties dialog box for the selected nets appears.
- 3. If the default value in the Tolerance box is not set to 200, type **200**. This limits the difference in routed length between the shortest and the longest nets in this group to 200 mils.
- 4. Select the **Restrict length** check box to enable length restrictions.
- 5. Type **2500** in the Minimum length box to establish a minimum length requirement of 2.5 inches for each net in the group.
- 6. Type **3500** in the Maximum length box to establish a maximum length requirement of 3.5 inches for each net in the group.
- 7. Click **OK** to accept the changes and close the dialog box.

**Monitoring compliance with matched length net rules**

The Length Monitor tab in the Spreadsheet window provides feedback when interactively tuning matched length traces.

The Length Monitor tab provides a color-coded view of length-controlled nets. It is updated in real-time and the fields change from yellow to green and from green to red, indicating each net's compliance with the length rules.

**See also:** "Length Monitor tab" in the *SailWind Router Help*

## Setting and using component-level rules
You can define specific design rules at the component level. These component-level rules let you set specific routing requirements on a

per-component basis. This lets you set special trace width and clearance rules for escaping traces from a high-density component, or setting specific pad entry rules for a particular connector.

**Setting component-level rules**

**To assign component routing and component clearance rules:**

- 1. In the Project Explorer, expand the Components branch to show all components in the design.
- 2. Scroll through the Components list. Select **U1**.
- 3. Right-click, click **Properties**, and click the **Clearance** tab. The Component Properties dialog box for the selected component appears.
- 4. Set a global clearance by clicking **All** in the upper left corner of the matrix. The input clearance value dialog box appears.
- 5. Type **12** as the global clearance and click **OK**. This specifies that all clearances related to this component will be 12 mils instead of the default used by other components.
- 6. Click **Apply** to accept the changes. **Result:** All affected fields in the dialog box are yellow, indicating that the rules differ from the default. A Changed Properties icon appears on the tab.
- 7. Click the **Routing** tab. In the Trace Width area, type **10** in the Minimum box, type **12** in the Recommended box, and type **15** in the Maximum box. This specifies that all traces connected to this component must observe these larger clearances, at least until the traces reach the outline of the part.
- 8. Click **Apply** to accept the changes.
- 9. Click the **Pad Entry** tab. The component pad entry options appear.
- 10. In the Enter pads through area, clear all check boxes. This allows traces to exit only straight out of the pads on this component.
- 11. Clear the **Ignore first corner rules to complete traces when required** check box.
- 12. Click **Apply** to accept the changes.
- 13. Click **OK** to close the Component Properties dialog box.

Try setting component-level rules for various components in the design. Notice that when the Component Properties dialog box is open, tabs with component-level rules that differ from the default rules have a Changed Properties icon.

**See also:** "Setting component properties" in the *SailWind Router Help*

## Rescheduling nets
**Options button > Global/General tab**

You can change the distribution of unroutes without returning to SailWind Layout ECO. You can override the default length minimization interconnect scheme and specify a particular order to interconnect the nets.

**Before rescheduling nets, set the Highlighted Object Display options:**

- 1. In the Highlighted object display area, click **Dimming other object colors** in the Distinguish highlighted objects by list.
- 2. Click **Apply** to accept the changes.
- 3. In the Brightness area, move the slider to the middle of the range between high and low. You can preview the results in the workspace area.
- 4. Click **OK** to close the Options dialog box.

**To reschedule a net:**

- 1. On the Standard toolbar, click the **Route Editing** button.
- 2. On the Route Editing toolbar, click the **Reschedule** button.
- 3. In the Project Explorer, expand the Net Objects tree.
- 4. Expand the Nets branch to show all nets in the design.
- 5. Click the net **A00** to select the net.

**Tip:** When you select a specific valid net to reschedule, all other nets in the workspace dim in the background to enhance the visibility of the selected net. When you finish rescheduling the selected connection, the workspace returns to full brightness until you select the next unroute. If you select a net that is invalid for rescheduling, the workspace does not dim and rescheduling is not allowed for the selected net.

6. In the workspace, select the top half of the left-most pin of the net (U6 pin 1).

**Tip:** When you hover the pointer over a pin, an in-place query is activated to give you information about why a particular pin can or cannot be connected. When the connection is available, the pointer changes to a bull's-eye indicating that the connection will be valid if completed.

**Result:** The net appears highlighted in the navigation window against a gray-scale background. When the pin is selected, the original unroute is replaced by a line that goes from a pin to the pointer.

- 7. Point to pin 1 of U6. This is the pin to which the unroute was originally connected (End of original unroute).
- 8. Point to the highlighted pin directly to the right. Pin 10 of U2 is disconnected (Start of unroute).
- 9. Point to either of the other highlighted pins at the lower part of the board. The pointer changes to a bull's eye.
- 10. Click one of the pins to reschedule the net connection.

**Tip:** When you click a pin to complete the rescheduling process the whole net switches to a Protected topology type. The Net Properties dialog box reflects this change and a message appears in the Command Window.

- 11. Practice rescheduling a few of the other nets in the design, noting the behavior of the pointer and the messages that appear. Connect some of them in daisy chain sequences and others as star topology arrangements.
- 12. When finished, click the **Reschedule** button on the Route Editing toolbar.
- 13. Do not save a copy of the design.

**You completed the adding traces with high-speed constraints tutorial.**
